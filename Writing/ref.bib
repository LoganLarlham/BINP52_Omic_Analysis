	abstract = {The advent of high-throughput single-cell transcriptomic analysis of microglia has revealed different phenotypes that are inherently associated with disease conditions. A common feature of some of these activated phenotypes is the upregulation of galectin-3. Representative examples of these phenotypes include disease-associated microglia ({DAM}) and white-associated microglia ({WAM}), whose role(s) in neuroprotection/neurotoxicity is a matter of high interest in the microglia community. In this review, we summarise the main findings that demonstrate the ability of galectin-3 to interact with key pattern recognition receptors, including, among others, {TLR}4 and {TREM}2 and the importance of galectin-3 in the regulation of microglia activation. Finally, we discuss increasing evidence supporting the involvement of this lectin in the main neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and stroke.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) is a detrimental neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatments. Due to cellular heterogeneity, defining the roles of immune cell subsets in {AD} onset and progression has been challenging. Using transcriptional single-cell sorting, we comprehensively map all immune populations in wild-type and {AD}-transgenic (Tg-{AD}) mouse brains. We describe a novel microglia type associated with neurodegenerative diseases ({DAM}) and identify markers, spatial localization, and pathways associated with these cells. Immunohistochemical staining of mice and human brain slices shows {DAM} with intracellular/phagocytic Aβ particles. Single-cell analysis of {DAM} in Tg-{AD} and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2)−/− Tg-{AD} reveals that the {DAM} program is activated in a two-step process. Activation is initiated in a Trem2-independent manner that involves downregulation of microglia checkpoints, followed by activation of a Trem2-dependent program. This unique microglia-type has the potential to restrict neurodegeneration, which may have important implications for future treatment of {AD} and other neurodegenerative diseases.

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) is the most common form of dementia characterized by the formation of amyloid plaques (Aβ). Over the last decade, the important role of the innate immune system for the disease development has been established. Chronic activation of microglial cells creates a proinflammatory environment, which is believed to be central for the development of the disease as well as its progression. We used the {AD} mouse model 5xFAD to investigate if inflammatory alterations are present in microglial cells before plaque deposition. We applied mass spectrometry and bioinformation analysis to elucidate early microglial alterations. Interestingly, we found the cytokines {IL}1β and {IL}10 to be elevated in the 5xFAD brain after the formation of Aβ plaque at 10 weeks only. Using mass spectrometry analysis of microglial cells with bioinformation analysis, we found {JAK}/{STAT}, p38 {MAPK} and Interleukin pathways affected in microglial cells before plaque deposition at 6 weeks. At 10 weeks, {GO} analysis showed affected pathways related to interferon-gamma regulation and {MAPK} pathways. Our study points toward early inflammatory changes in microglial cells even before the accumulation of Aβ.},

	abstract = {{ApoE} is the major lipid and cholesterol carrier in the {CNS}. There are three major human polymorphisms, {apoE}2, {apoE}3, and {apoE}4, and the genetic expression of {APOE}4 is one of the most influential risk factors for the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease ({AD}). Neuroinflammation has become the third hallmark of {AD}, together with Amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated aggregated tau protein. This review aims to broadly and extensively describe the differential aspects concerning {apoE}. Starting from the evolution of {apoE} to how {APOE}'s single-nucleotide polymorphisms affect its structure, function, and involvement during health and disease. This review reflects on how {APOE}'s polymorphisms impact critical aspects of {AD} pathology, such as the neuroinflammatory response, particularly the effect of {APOE} on astrocytic and microglial function and microglial dynamics, synaptic function, amyloid-β load, tau pathology, autophagy, and cell–cell communication. We discuss influential factors affecting {AD} pathology combined with the {APOE} genotype, such as sex, age, diet, physical exercise, current therapies and clinical trials in the {AD} field. The impact of the {APOE} genotype in other neurodegenerative diseases characterized by overt inflammation, e.g., alpha- synucleinopathies and Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis, is also addressed. Therefore, this review gathers the most relevant findings related to the {APOE} genotype up to date and its implications on {AD} and {CNS} pathologies to provide a deeper understanding of the knowledge in the {APOE} field.},

	abstract = {Droplet-based 3’ single-cell {RNA}-sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) methods have proved transformational in characterizing cellular diversity and generating valuable hypotheses throughout biology1,2. Here we outline a common problem with 3’ {scRNA}-seq datasets where genes that have been documented to be expressed with other methods, are either completely missing or are dramatically under-represented thereby compromising the discovery of cell types, states, and genetic mechanisms. We show that this problem stems from three main sources of sequencing read loss: (1) reads mapping immediately 3’ to known gene boundaries due to poor 3’ {UTR} annotation; (2) intronic reads stemming from unannotated exons or pre-{mRNA}; (3) discarded reads due to gene overlaps3. Each of these issues impacts the detection of thousands of genes even in well-characterized mouse and human genomes rendering downstream analysis either partially or fully blind to their expression. We outline a simple three-step solution to recover the missing gene expression data that entails compiling a hybrid pre-{mRNA} reference to retrieve intronic reads4, resolving gene collision derived read loss through removal of readthrough and premature start transcripts, and redefining 3’ gene boundaries to capture false intergenic reads. We demonstrate with mouse brain and human peripheral blood datasets that this approach dramatically increases the amount of sequencing data included in downstream analysis revealing 20 - 50\% more genes per cell and incorporates 15-20\% more sequencing reads than with standard solutions5. These improvements reveal previously missing biologically relevant cell types, states, and marker genes in the mouse brain and human blood profiling data. Finally, we provide {scRNA}-seq optimized transcriptomic references for human and mouse data as well as simple algorithmic implementation of these solutions that can be deployed to both thoroughly as well as poorly annotated genomes. Our results demonstrate that optimizing the sequencing read mapping step can significantly improve the analysis resolution as well as biological insight from {scRNA}-seq. Moreover, this approach warrants a fresh look at preceding analyses of this popular and scalable cellular profiling technology.},

Current understanding revolves around microglia acquiring distinct phenotypes upon exposure to extrinsic cues in their environment. However, emerging evidence suggests that microglia display differences in their functions that are not exclusively driven by their milieu, rather by the unique properties these cells possess. This microglial intrinsic heterogeneity has been largely overlooked, favoring the prevailing view that microglia are a single‐cell type endowed with spectacular plasticity, allowing them to acquire multiple phenotypes and thereby fulfill their numerous functions in health and disease. Here, we review the evidence that microglia might form a community of cells in which each member (or “subtype”) displays intrinsic properties and performs unique functions. Distinctive features and functional implications of several microglial subtypes are considered, across contexts of health and disease. Finally, we suggest that microglial subtype categorization shall be based on function and we propose ways for studying them. Hence, we advocate that plasticity (reaction states) and diversity (subtypes) should both be considered when studying the multitasking microglia.},

Across six major brain cell types, we identified transcriptionally distinct subpopulations, including those associated with pathology and characterized by regulators of myelination, inflammation, and neuron survival. The strongest disease-associated changes appeared early in pathological progression and were highly cell-type specific, whereas genes upregulated at late stages were common across cell types and primarily involved in the global stress response. Notably, we found that female cells were overrepresented in disease-associated subpopulations, and that transcriptional responses were substantially different between sexes in several cell types, including oligodendrocytes. Overall, myelination-related processes were recurrently perturbed in multiple cell types, suggesting that myelination has a key role in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.

	abstract = {Microglia play a pivotal role in the maintenance of brain homeostasis but lose homeostatic function during neurodegenerative disorders. We identified a specific apolipoprotein E ({APOE})-dependent molecular signature in microglia from models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS}), multiple sclerosis ({MS}), and Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) and in microglia surrounding neuritic β-amyloid (Aβ)-plaques in the brains of people with {AD}. The {APOE} pathway mediated a switch from a homeostatic to a neurodegenerative microglia phenotype after phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons. {TREM}2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) induced {APOE} signaling, and targeting the {TREM}2-{APOE} pathway restored the homeostatic signature of microglia in {ALS} and {AD} mouse models and prevented neuronal loss in an acute model of neurodegeneration. {APOE}-mediated neurodegenerative microglia had lost their tolerogenic function. Our work identifies the {TREM}2-{APOE} pathway as a major regulator of microglial functional phenotype in neurodegenerative diseases and serves as a novel target that could aid in the restoration of homeostatic microglia.},

	abstract = {The mammalian brain consists of millions to billions of cells that are organized into many cell types with specific spatial distribution patterns and structural and functional properties1–3. Here we report a comprehensive and high-resolution transcriptomic and spatial cell-type atlas for the whole adult mouse brain. The cell-type atlas was created by combining a single-cell {RNA}-sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) dataset of around 7 million cells profiled (approximately 4.0 million cells passing quality control), and a spatial transcriptomic dataset of approximately 4.3 million cells using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization ({MERFISH}). The atlas is hierarchically organized into 4 nested levels of classification: 34 classes, 338 subclasses, 1,201 supertypes and 5,322 clusters. We present an online platform, Allen Brain Cell Atlas, to visualize the mouse whole-brain cell-type atlas along with the single-cell {RNA}-sequencing and {MERFISH} datasets. We systematically analysed the neuronal and non-neuronal cell types across the brain and identified a high degree of correspondence between transcriptomic identity and spatial specificity for each cell type. The results reveal unique features of cell-type organization in different brain regions—in particular, a dichotomy between the dorsal and ventral parts of the brain. The dorsal part contains relatively fewer yet highly divergent neuronal types, whereas the ventral part contains more numerous neuronal types that are more closely related to each other. Our study also uncovered extraordinary diversity and heterogeneity in neurotransmitter and neuropeptide expression and co-expression patterns in different cell types. Finally, we found that transcription factors are major determinants of cell-type classification and identified a combinatorial transcription factor code that defines cell types across all parts of the brain. The whole mouse brain transcriptomic and spatial cell-type atlas establishes a benchmark reference atlas and a foundational resource for integrative investigations of cellular and circuit function, development and evolution of the mammalian brain.},

Aβ plaques had more differentially expressed genes than tangles. We identified a gradient Aβ plaque {\textgreater} peri-plaque {\textgreater} tangle {\textgreater} distant for these changes. {AD} {APOE} ε4 homozygotes had greater changes than {APOE} ε3 across locations, especially within Aβ plaques. {DISCUSSION} Transcriptomic changes in {AD} consist primarily of neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction, are spatially associated mainly with Aβ plaques, and are exacerbated by the {APOE} ε4 allele.},

One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

We show that a {RiboTag} translational profiling approach can bypass biases due to cellular enrichment/cell sorting. Using this approach in models of amyloidosis, tauopathy, and aging, we revealed a common set of alterations and identified a central {APOE}-driven network that converged on {CCL}3 and {CCL}4 across all conditions. Notably, aged females demonstrated a significant exacerbation of many of these shared transcripts in this {APOE} network, revealing a potential mechanism for increased {AD} susceptibility in females. This study has broad implications for microglial transcriptomic approaches and provides new insights into microglial pathways associated with different pathological aspects of aging and {AD}.},

Differential Expression ({DE}) analysis is a major downstream analysis of {scRNA}-seq data. {DE} analysis the in presence of noises from different sources remains a key challenge in {scRNA}-seq. Earlier practices for addressing this involved borrowing methods from bulk {RNA}-seq, which are based on non-zero differences in average expressions of genes across cell populations. Later, several methods specifically designed for {scRNA}-seq were developed. To provide guidance on choosing an appropriate tool or developing a new one, it is necessary to comprehensively study the performance of {DE} analysis methods. Here, we provide a review and classification of different {DE} approaches adapted from bulk {RNA}-seq practice as well as those specifically designed for {scRNA}-seq. We also evaluate the performance of 19 widely used methods in terms of 13 performance metrics on 11 real {scRNA}-seq datasets. Our findings suggest that some bulk {RNA}-seq methods are quite competitive with the single-cell methods and their performance depends on the underlying models, {DE} test statistic(s), and data characteristics. Further, it is difficult to obtain the method which will be best-performing globally through individual performance criterion. However, the multi-criteria and combined-data analysis indicates that {DECENT} and {EBSeq} are the best options for {DE} analysis. The results also reveal the similarities among the tested methods in terms of detecting common {DE} genes. Our evaluation provides proper guidelines for selecting the proper tool which performs best under particular experimental settings in the context of the {scRNA}-seq.},

The presence of such systematic background noise is a potential source of batch effect and spurious differential gene expression. Here we develop a deep generative model for noise-contaminated data that is structured to reflect the phenomenology of background noise generation in droplet-based single-cell assays. The proposed model successfully distinguishes cell-containing from cell-free droplets without supervision, learns the profile of background noise, and retrieves a noise-free quantification in an end-to-end fashion. We present a scalable and robust implementation of our method as a module in the open-source software package {CellBender}. We show that {CellBender} operates close to the theoretically optimal denoising limit in simulated datasets, and present extensive evaluations using real datasets and experimental benchmarks drawn from different tissues, protocols, and modalities to show that {CellBender} significantly improves the agreement of droplet-based single-cell data with established gene expression patterns, and that the learned background noise profile provides evidence for degraded or uncaptured cell types.},

	abstract = {Long noncoding {RNA} ({lncRNA}) metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 ({MALAT}1) was widely recognized to be implicated in human cancer, vascular diseases, and neurological disorders. This study was to explore the role and underlying mechanism of {MALAT}1 in acute spinal cord injury ({ASCI}). {ASCI} models in adult rats were established and demonstrated by a numerical decrease in {BBB} scores. Expression profile of {MALAT}1 and {miR}-199b following {ASCI} in rats and in vitro was determined using quantitative real-time {PCR}. {RNA} pull-down assays combined with {RIP} assays were performed to explore the interaction between {MALAT}1 and {miR}-199b. In the present study, {MALAT}1 expression was significantly increased (2.4-fold that of control) in the spinal cord of the rat contusion epicenter accompanied by activation of {IKKβ}/{NF}-κB signaling pathway and an increase in the level of proinflammatory cytokines {TNF}-α and {IL}-1β. Upon treatment with {LPS}, {MALAT}1 expression dramatically increased in the microglia in vitro, but knockdown of {MALAT}1 attenuated {LPS}-induced activation of {MGs} and {TNF}-α and {IL}-1β production. Next, we confirmed that {LPS}-induced {MALAT}1 activated {IKKβ}/{NF}-κB signaling pathway and promoted the production of proinflammatory cytokines {TNF}-α and {IL}-1β through downregulating {miR}-199b. More importantly, {MALAT}1 knockdown gradually improved the hindlimb locomotor activity of {ASCI} rats as well as inhibited {TNF}-α, {IL}-1β levels, and Iba-1 protein, the marker of activated microglia in injured spinal cords. Our study demonstrated that {MALAT}1 was dysregulated in {ASCI} rats and in {LPS}-activated {MGs}, and {MALAT}1 knockdown was expected to attenuate {ASCI} through repressing inflammatory response of {MGs}.},

	abstract = {Our previous studies have discovered that long non-coding {RNA} ({lncRNA}) {MALAT}1 and its target {microRNA}-125b-5p ({miR}-125b-5p) are implicated in neurological diseases via regulating neuroinflammation and neuronal injury. This study aimed to further explore the relationship between {lncRNA} {MALAT}1 and {miR}-125b-5p, as well as their effect on microglial activation, neuroinflammation, and neural apoptosis in spinal cord injury ({SCI}). Primary microglia from Sprague Dawley rats were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}). Then, microglia were transfected with {lncRNA} {MALAT}1 overexpression or knock-down adenovirus-associated virus with or without {miR}-125b-5p mimic. The culture medium of microglia was incubated with primary neurons. {SCI} rats were established for in vivo validation. {LncRNA} {MALAT}1 expression was reduced by {LPS} treatment in a dose-dependent manner. {LncRNA} {MALAT}1 overexpression suppressed the microglial M1 polarization (decreased {iNOS} but increased {ARG}1), neuroinflammation (declined {PTGS}2, {TNF}-α, {IL}-1β, and {IL}-6), and microglia-induced neural apoptosis (lower {TUNEL} positive cells and C-caspase3 but higher {BCL}2) under {LPS} treatment; its knock-down displayed the opposite trend. Moreover, {lncRNA} {MALAT}1 directly bound to and negatively regulated {miR}-125b-5p. {MiR}-125b-5p mimic promoted microglial M1 polarization, neuroinflammation, and microglia-induced neural apoptosis following {LPS} treatment; also, it could attenuate the effect of {lncRNA} {MALAT}1. Further in vivo study displayed that {lncRNA} {MALAT}1 overexpression elevated the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan motor function score and improved neural injury. Also, in vivo validation indicated a similar effect of {lncRNA} {MALAT}1 on microglial polarization and neuroinflammation as in vitro. {LncRNA} {MALAT}1 improves {SCI} recovery via {miR}-125b-5p mediated microglial M1 polarization, neuroinflammation, and neural apoptosis.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {APOE} genotype is the greatest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease ({AD}). {APOE}4 increases {AD} risk up to 12-fold compared to {APOE}3, an effect that is greater in females. Evidence suggests that one-way {APOE} could modulate {AD} risk and progression through neuroinflammation. Indeed, {APOE}4 is associated with higher glial activation and cytokine levels in {AD} patients and mice. Therefore, identifying pathways that contribute to {APOE}4-associated neuroinflammation is an important approach for understanding and treating {AD}. Human and in vivo evidence suggests that {TLR}4, one of the key receptors involved in the innate immune system, could be involved in {APOE}-modulated neuroinflammation. Consistent with that idea, we previously demonstrated that the {TLR}4 antagonist {IAXO}-101 can reduce {LPS}- and Aβ-induced cytokine secretion in {APOE}4 glial cultures. Therefore, the goal of this study was to advance these findings and determine whether {IAXO}-101 can modulate neuroinflammation, Aβ pathology, and behavior in mice that express {APOE}4.
{METHODS}: We used mice that express five familial {AD} mutations and human {APOE}3 (E3FAD) or {APOE}4 (E4FAD). Female and male E4FAD mice and female E3FAD mice were treated with vehicle or {IAXO}-101 in two treatment paradigms: prevention from 4 to 6 months of age or reversal from 6 to 7 months of age. Learning and memory were assessed by modified Morris water maze. Aβ deposition, fibrillar amyloid deposition, astrogliosis, and microgliosis were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Soluble levels of Aβ and {apoE}, insoluble levels of {apoE} and Aβ, and {IL}-1β were measured by {ELISA}.
{RESULTS}: {IAXO}-101 treatment resulted in lower Iba-1 coverage, lower number of reactive microglia, and improved memory in female E4FAD mice in both prevention and reversal paradigms. {IAXO}-101-treated male E4FAD mice also had lower Iba-1 coverage and reactivity in the {RVS} paradigm, but there was no effect on behavior. There was also no effect of {IAXO}-101 treatment on neuroinflammation and behavior in female E3FAD mice.
{CONCLUSION}: Our data supports that {TLR}4 is a potential mechanistic therapeutic target for modulating neuroinflammation and cognition in {APOE}4 females.},

Here, we explore monocyte trafficking in the context of acute inflammation, relying predominantly on data from microbial infection models. These mechanisms will be compared to monocyte trafficking during chronic inflammation in experimental models of atherosclerosis. Recent developments suggest that monocyte trafficking shares common themes in diverse inflammatory diseases; however, important differences exist between monocyte migratory pathways in acute and chronic inflammation.},

	abstract = {Studies in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and so on, have suggested that inflammation is not only a result of neurodegeneration but also a crucial player in this process. Protein aggregates which are very common pathological phenomenon in neurodegeneration can induce neuroinflammation which further aggravates protein aggregation and neurodegeneration. Actually, inflammation even happens earlier than protein aggregation. Neuroinflammation induced by genetic variations in {CNS} cells or by peripheral immune cells may induce protein deposition in some susceptible population. Numerous signaling pathways and a range of {CNS} cells have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration, although they are still far from being completely understood. Due to the limited success of traditional treatment methods, blocking or enhancing inflammatory signaling pathways involved in neurodegeneration are considered to be promising strategies for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases, and many of them have got exciting results in animal models or clinical trials. Some of them, although very few, have been approved by {FDA} for clinical usage. Here we comprehensively review the factors affecting neuroinflammation and the major inflammatory signaling pathways involved in the pathogenicity of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We also summarize the current strategies, both in animal models and in the clinic, for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.},

An unbiased {CRISPR}–Cas9 screen identified genetic modifiers of lipid droplet formation; surprisingly, variants of several of these genes, including progranulin ({GRN}), are causes of autosomal-dominant forms of human neurodegenerative diseases. We therefore propose that {LDAM} contribute to age-related and genetic forms of neurodegeneration.},

	abstract = {Neuroinflammation is a common feature of diverse nervous system pathologies. In many instances, it begins at an early stage of the disease, paving the way for further exacerbations. The main drivers of neuroinflammation are brain-resident glial cells, such as microglia and astrocytes. Microglia are the primary responders to any insult to the brain parenchyma, translating the signals into diverse molecules. These molecules derived from microglia can regulate the stimuli-dependent reactivity of astrocytes. Once activated, astrocytes in turn, can control microglia phenotypes. Recent evidence indicates that the crosstalk between these glial cells plays an important role in delaying or accelerating neuroinflammation and overall disease progression. To date, various molecules have been recognized as key mediators of the bidirectional communication between microglia and astrocytes. The current review aims to discuss the novel molecules identified recently, which play a critical role in interglial crosstalk, highlighting their therapeutic potential.},

Despite this popularity, there are concerns that these methods are being applied incorrectly and the results of some peer-reviewed publications are unreliable. These problems include the use of inappropriate background gene lists, lack of false discovery rate correction and lack of methodological detail. To ascertain the frequency of these issues in the literature, we performed a screen of 186 open-access research articles describing functional enrichment results. We find that 95\% of analyses using over-representation tests did not implement an appropriate background gene list or did not describe this in the methods. Failure to perform p-value correction for multiple tests was identified in 43\% of analyses. Many studies lacked detail in the methods section about the tools and gene sets used. An extension of this survey showed that these problems are not associated with journal or article level bibliometrics. Using seven independent {RNA}-seq datasets, we show misuse of enrichment tools alters results substantially. In conclusion, most published functional enrichment studies suffered from one or more major flaws, highlighting the need for stronger standards for enrichment analysis.},

However, there were limitations in both their data processing and quality control and their differential expression analysis.

Despite its popularity, this type of selection overlooks the fact that {BH} does not guarantee error control over filtered subsets of discoveries. Therefore the selected subset of features may include an inflated number of false discoveries.In this paper, we illustrate the substantially inflated type I error rate of volcano plot selection with simulation experiments and {RNA}-seq data. In particular, we show that the feature with the largest estimated effect is a very likely false positive result. Next, we investigate two alternative approaches for multiple testing with double filtering that do not inflate the false discovery rate.

Here we show that nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells ({NF}-κB) signaling, activated by tau, drives microglial-mediated tau propagation and toxicity. Constitutive activation of microglial {NF}-κB exacerbated, while inactivation diminished, tau seeding and spreading in young {PS}19 mice. Inhibition of {NF}-κB activation enhanced the retention while reduced the release of internalized pathogenic tau fibrils from primary microglia and rescued microglial autophagy deficits. Inhibition of microglial {NF}-κB in aged {PS}19 mice rescued tau-mediated learning and memory deficits, restored overall transcriptomic changes while increasing neuronal tau inclusions. Single cell {RNA}-seq revealed that tau-associated disease states in microglia were diminished by {NF}-κB inactivation and further transformed by constitutive {NF}-κB activation.

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive decline, affecting behavior, speech, and motor abilities. The neuropathology of {AD} includes the formation of extracellular amyloid-β plaque and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of phosphorylated tau, along with neuronal loss. While neuronal loss is an {AD} hallmark, cell-cell communication between neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations maintains neuronal health and brain homeostasis. To study changes in cellcell communication during disease progression, we performed {snRNA}-sequencing of the hippocampus from female 3xTg-{AD} and wild-type littermates at 6 and 12 months. We inferred differential cell-cell communication between 3xTg-{AD} and wild-type mice across time points and between senders (astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and {OPCs}) and receivers (excitatory and inhibitory neurons) of interest. We also assessed the downstream effects of altered glia-neuron communication using pseudobulk differential gene expression, functional enrichment, and gene regulatory analyses. We found that glia-neuron communication is increasingly dysregulated in 12-month 3xTg-{AD} mice. We also identified 23 {AD}-associated ligand-receptor pairs that are upregulated in the 12-month-old 3xTg-{AD} hippocampus. Our results suggest increased {AD} association of interactions originating from microglia. Signaling mediators were not significantly differentially expressed but showed altered gene regulation and {TF} activity. Our findings indicate that altered glia-neuron communication is increasingly dysregulated and affects the gene regulatory mechanisms in neurons of 12-month-old 3xTg-{AD} mice.},

Here, we directly explore the potential plasticity of adipocytes and fibroblasts after skin injury. Using genetic lineage tracing and live imaging in explants and in wounded animals, we observe that injury induces a transient migratory state in adipocytes with vastly distinct cell migration patterns and behaviours from fibroblasts. Furthermore, migratory adipocytes, do not contribute to scar formation and remain non-fibrogenic in vitro, in vivo and upon transplantation into wounds in animals. Using single-cell and bulk transcriptomics we confirm that wound adipocytes do not convert into fibrogenic myofibroblasts. In summary, the injury-induced migratory adipocytes remain lineage-restricted and do not converge or reprogram into a fibrosing phenotype. These findings broadly impact basic and translational strategies in the regenerative medicine field, including clinical interventions for wound repair, diabetes, and fibrotic pathologies.},

	abstract = {Neurological diseases are associated with disruptions in the brain lipidome that are becoming central to disease pathogenesis. Traditionally perceived as static structural support in membranes, lipids are now known to be actively involved in cellular signaling, energy metabolism, and other cellular activities involving membrane curvature, fluidity, fusion or fission. Glia are critical in the development, health, and function of the brain, and glial regulation plays a major role in disease. The major pathways of glial dysregulation related to function are associated with downstream products of metabolism including lipids. Taking advantage of significant innovations and technical advancements in instrumentation, lipidomics has emerged as a popular omics discipline, serving as the prevailing approach to comprehensively define metabolic alterations associated with organismal development, damage or disease. A key technological platform for lipidomics studies is mass spectrometry ({MS}), as it affords large-scale profiling of complex biological samples. However, as {MS}-based techniques are often refined and advanced, the relative comfort level among biologists with this instrumentation has not followed suit. In this review, we aim to highlight the importance of the study of glial lipids and to provide a concise record of best practices and steps for {MS}-based lipidomics. Specifically, we outline procedures for glia lipidomics workflows ranging from sample collection and extraction to mass spectrometric analysis to data interpretation. To ensure these approaches are more accessible, this tutorial aims to familiarize glia biologists with sample handling and analysis techniques for {MS}-based lipidomics, and to guide non-experts toward generating high quality lipidomics data.},

Here, we review the cell types and pathological mechanisms involved in disease development as well as the influence of genetics and lifestyle factors. Given the decade-long preclinical stage of Alzheimer disease, these mechanisms and their interactions are driving forces behind the spread and progression of the disease. The identification of treatment opportunities will require a precise understanding of the cells and mechanisms involved as well as a clear definition of their temporal and topographical nature.

While the detailed molecular mechanisms of the pathway and the spatial-temporal dynamics leading to synaptic failure, neurodegeneration, and clinical onset are still under intense investigation, the established biochemical alterations of the Aβ cycle remain the core biological hallmark of {AD} and are promising targets for the development of disease-modifying therapies. Here, we systematically review and update the vast state-of-the-art literature of Aβ science with evidence from basic research studies to human genetic and multi-modal biomarker investigations, which supports a crucial role of Aβ pathway dyshomeostasis in {AD} pathophysiological dynamics. We discuss the evidence highlighting a differentiated interaction of distinct Aβ species with other {AD}-related biological mechanisms, such as tau-mediated, neuroimmune and inflammatory changes, as well as a neurochemical imbalance. Through the lens of the latest development of multimodal in vivo biomarkers of {AD}, this cross-disciplinary review examines the compelling hypothesis- and data-driven rationale for Aβ-targeting therapeutic strategies in development for the early treatment of {AD}.},

Except for the recently {FDA}-approved Aducanumab of which the therapeutic effect is not yet conclusively proven, only symptomatic medication that is effective for some {AD} patients is available. In order to be able to design more rational and effective treatments, our understanding of the mechanisms behind the pathogenesis and progression of {AD} urgently needs to be improved. Over the last years, it became increasingly clear that peripheral inflammation is one of the detrimental factors that can contribute to the disease. Here, we discuss the current understanding of how systemic and intestinal (referred to as the gut-brain axis) inflammatory processes may affect brain pathology, with a specific focus on {AD}. Moreover, we give a comprehensive overview of the different preclinical as well as clinical studies that link peripheral Inflammation to {AD} initiation and progression. Altogether, this review broadens our understanding of the mechanisms behind {AD} pathology and may help in the rational design of further research aiming to identify novel therapeutic targets.},

In a variety of neurodegenerative settings, microglia alter their transcriptional profile, morphology and function in similar ways; thus, these activated cells have been called ‘degeneration- or disease-associated microglia’ ({DAM}). These activated microglia can perform different functions and exert both positive effects and negative effects in different mouse disease models. In humans, mutations in genes expressed in microglia are linked to various neurodegenerative diseases. Here we provide an overview of the common microglial response to neurodegeneration and key contributing pathways; delineate the multifaceted functions of activated microglia spanning various diseases; and discuss insights from the study of human disease-associated genes. We argue that strong evidence from both mouse models and human genetics causally links the function of activated microglia to neurodegeneration.},

While many protocols have been optimized for optimal cell yield, they have often overlooked the effects that dissociation can have on ex vivo gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that use of enzymatic dissociation on brain tissue induces an aberrant ex vivo gene expression signature, most prominently in microglia, which is prevalent in published literature and can substantially confound downstream analyses. To address this issue, we present a rigorously validated protocol that preserves both in vivo transcriptional profiles and cell-type diversity and yield across tissue types and species. We also identify a similar signature in postmortem human brain single-nucleus {RNA}-sequencing datasets, and show that this signature is induced in freshly isolated human tissue by exposure to elevated temperatures ex vivo. Together, our results provide a methodological solution for preventing artifactual gene expression changes during fresh tissue digestion and a reference for future deeper analysis of the potential confounding states present in postmortem human samples.},

However, while alterations in microglial morphology and gene expression are observed in human postmortem brain tissue, the mechanisms by which microglia drive and contribute to {AD} pathology remain ill-defined. Numerous mouse models have been developed to facilitate the disambiguation of the biological mechanisms underlying {AD}, incorporating amyloidosis, phosphorylated tau, or both. Over time, the use of multiple technologies including bulk tissue and single cell transcriptomics, epigenomics, spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics have shed light on the heterogeneity of microglial phenotypes and molecular patterns altered in {AD} mouse models. Each of these 'omics technologies provide unique information and biological insight.

	abstract = {Polygenic risk scores have identified that genetic variants without genome-wide significance still add to the genetic risk of developing Alzheimer's disease ({AD}). Whether and how subthreshold risk loci translate into relevant disease pathways is unknown. We investigate here the involvement of {AD} risk variants in the transcriptional responses of two mouse models: {APPswe}/{PS}1L166P and Thy-{TAU}22. A unique gene expression module, highly enriched for {AD} risk genes, is specifically responsive to Aβ but not {TAU} pathology. We identify in this module 7 established {AD} risk genes ({APOE}, {CLU}, {INPP}5D, {CD}33, {PLCG}2, {SPI}1, and {FCER}1G) and 11 {AD} {GWAS} genes below the genome-wide significance threshold ({GPC}2, {TREML}2, {SYK}, {GRN}, {SLC}2A5, {SAMSN}1, {PYDC}1, {HEXB}, {RRBP}1, {LYN}, and {BLNK}), that become significantly upregulated when exposed to Aβ. Single microglia sequencing confirms that Aβ, not {TAU}, pathology induces marked transcriptional changes in microglia, including increased proportions of activated microglia. We conclude that genetic risk of {AD} functionally translates into different microglia pathway responses to Aβ pathology, placing {AD} genetic risk downstream of the amyloid pathway but upstream of {TAU} pathology.},

Notably, 5XFAD mice lacking {MHCII} exhibited an enhanced amyloid pathology in the brain along with exacerbated innate inflammation and reduced phagocytic capacity. Using a bone marrow chimera mouse model, we showed that infiltrating macrophages did not differentiate to {MHCII}+ cells following {ICV} injection of Aβ-Th1 cells and did not support T cell-mediated amyloid clearance.

New designations continuously arising in an attempt to describe the different microglial states, notably defined using transcriptomics and proteomics, may easily lead to a misleading, although unintentional, coupling of categories and functions. To address these issues, we assembled a group of multidisciplinary experts to discuss our current understanding of microglial states as a dynamic concept and the importance of addressing microglial function. Here, we provide a conceptual framework and recommendations on the use of microglial nomenclature for researchers, reviewers, and editors, which will serve as the foundations for a future white paper.},

How genetic risk factors, like {APOE} and {TREM}2, intersect with cellular responses to beta-amyloid in human tissues is not fully understood. Using single-nucleus {RNA} sequencing of postmortem human brain with varied {APOE} and {TREM}2 genotypes and neuropathology, we identified distinct microglia subpopulations, including a subpopulation of {CD}163-positive amyloid-responsive microglia ({ARM}) that are depleted in cases with {APOE} and {TREM}2 risk variants. We validated our single-nucleus {RNA} sequencing findings in an expanded cohort of {AD} cases, demonstrating that {APOE} and {TREM}2 risk variants are associated with a significant reduction in {CD}163-positive amyloid-responsive microglia. Our results showcase the diverse microglial response in {AD} and underscore how genetic risk factors influence cellular responses to underlying pathologies.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer disease ({AD}) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disease, estimated to contribute 60–70\% of all cases of dementia worldwide. According to the prevailing amyloid cascade hypothesis, amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in the brain is the initiating event in {AD}, although evidence is accumulating that this hypothesis is insufficient to explain many aspects of {AD} pathogenesis. The discovery of increased levels of inflammatory markers in patients with {AD} and the identification of {AD} risk genes associated with innate immune functions suggest that neuroinflammation has a prominent role in the pathogenesis of {AD}. In this Review, we discuss the interrelationships between neuroinflammation and amyloid and tau pathologies as well as the effect of neuroinflammation on the disease trajectory in {AD}. We specifically focus on microglia as major players in neuroinflammation and discuss the spatial and temporal variations in microglial phenotypes that are observed under different conditions. We also consider how these cells could be modulated as a therapeutic strategy for {AD}.},

This Primer conceives of {AD} biology as the brain disorder that results from a complex interplay of loss of synaptic homeostasis and dysfunction in the highly interrelated endosomal/lysosomal clearance pathways in which the precursors, aggregated species and post-translationally modified products of Aβ and tau play important roles.

	shorttitle = {{NIA}-{AA} Research Framework},
	abstract = {In 2011, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association created separate diagnostic recommendations for the preclinical, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia stages of Alzheimer's disease. Scientific progress in the interim led to an initiative by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association to update and unify the 2011 guidelines. This unifying update is labeled a “research framework” because its intended use is for observational and interventional research, not routine clinical care. In the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association Research Framework, Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) is defined by its underlying pathologic processes that can be documented by postmortem examination or in vivo by biomarkers. The diagnosis is not based on the clinical consequences of the disease (i.e., symptoms/signs) in this research framework, which shifts the definition of {AD} in living people from a syndromal to a biological construct. The research framework focuses on the diagnosis of {AD} with biomarkers in living persons. Biomarkers are grouped into those of β amyloid deposition, pathologic tau, and neurodegeneration [{AT}(N)]. This {ATN} classification system groups different biomarkers (imaging and biofluids) by the pathologic process each measures. The {AT}(N) system is flexible in that new biomarkers can be added to the three existing {AT}(N) groups, and new biomarker groups beyond {AT}(N) can be added when they become available. We focus on {AD} as a continuum, and cognitive staging may be accomplished using continuous measures. However, we also outline two different categorical cognitive schemes for staging the severity of cognitive impairment: a scheme using three traditional syndromal categories and a six-stage numeric scheme. It is important to stress that this framework seeks to create a common language with which investigators can generate and test hypotheses about the interactions among different pathologic processes (denoted by biomarkers) and cognitive symptoms. We appreciate the concern that this biomarker-based research framework has the potential to be misused. Therefore, we emphasize, first, it is premature and inappropriate to use this research framework in general medical practice. Second, this research framework should not be used to restrict alternative approaches to hypothesis testing that do not use biomarkers. There will be situations where biomarkers are not available or requiring them would be counterproductive to the specific research goals (discussed in more detail later in the document). Thus, biomarker-based research should not be considered a template for all research into age-related cognitive impairment and dementia; rather, it should be applied when it is fit for the purpose of the specific research goals of a study. Importantly, this framework should be examined in diverse populations. Although it is possible that β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau deposits are not causal in {AD} pathogenesis, it is these abnormal protein deposits that define {AD} as a unique neurodegenerative disease among different disorders that can lead to dementia. We envision that defining {AD} as a biological construct will enable a more accurate characterization and understanding of the sequence of events that lead to cognitive impairment that is associated with {AD}, as well as the multifactorial etiology of dementia. This approach also will enable a more precise approach to interventional trials where specific pathways can be targeted in the disease process and in the appropriate people.},

Due to its increased power and interpretability, genetically regulated expression ({GReX}) analysis is an emerging approach to investigate the genetic mechanisms of complex diseases. Here, we conducted {GReX} analysis within and across 51 tissues on 39 {LOAD} {GWAS} data sets comprising 58,713 cases and controls from the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium ({ADGC}) and the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project ({IGAP}). Meta-analysis across studies identified 216 unique significant genes, including 72 with no previously reported {LOAD} {GWAS} associations. Cross-brain-tissue and cross-{GTEx} models revealed eight additional genes significantly associated with {LOAD}. Conditional analysis of previously reported loci using established {LOAD}-risk variants identified eight genes reaching genome-wide significance independent of known signals. Moreover, the proportion of {SNP}-based heritability is highly enriched in genes identified by {GReX} analysis. In summary, {GReX}-based meta-analysis in {LOAD} identifies 216 genes (including 72 novel genes), illuminating the role of gene regulatory models in {LOAD}.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s dementia is significantly more common in women than in men. However, few pathological studies have addressed sex difference in Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) and other brain pathologies. We leveraged postmortem data from 1453 persons who participated in one of two longitudinal community-based studies of older adults, the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Postmortem examination identified {AD} pathologies, neocortical Lewy bodies, {DNA}-binding protein 43 ({TDP}-43), hippocampal sclerosis, gross and micro infarcts, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Linear and logistic regressions examined the association of sex with each of the pathologic measures. Two-thirds of subjects were women (n = 971; 67\%), with a mean age at death of 89.8 ({SD} = 6.6) years in women and 87.3 ({SD} = 6.6) in men. Adjusted for age and education, women had higher levels on a global measure of {AD} pathology (estimate = 0.102, {SE} = 0.022, p {\textless} 0.001), and tau tangle density in particular (estimate = 0.334, {SE} = 0.074, p {\textless} 0.001), and there was a borderline difference between women and men in amyloid-β load (estimate = 0.124, {SE} = 0.065, p = 0.056). In addition, compared to men, women were more likely to have more severe arteriolosclerosis ({OR} = 1.28, 95\% {CI}:1.04–1.58, p = 0.018), and less likely to have gross infarcts ({OR} = 0.78, 95\% {CI}:0.61–0.98, p = 0.037), although the association with gross infarct was attenuated after controlling for vascular risk factors.

	abstract = {Despite continuing debate about the amyloid β‐protein (or Aβ hypothesis, new lines of evidence from laboratories and clinics worldwide support the concept that an imbalance between production and clearance of Aβ42 and related Aβ peptides is a very early, often initiating factor in Alzheimer's disease ({AD}). Confirmation that presenilin is the catalytic site of γ‐secretase has provided a linchpin: all dominant mutations causing early‐onset {AD} occur either in the substrate (amyloid precursor protein, {APP}) or the protease (presenilin) of the reaction that generates Aβ. Duplication of the wild‐type {APP} gene in Down's syndrome leads to Aβ deposits in the teens, followed by microgliosis, astrocytosis, and neurofibrillary tangles typical of {AD}. Apolipoprotein E4, which predisposes to {AD} in {\textgreater} 40\% of cases, has been found to impair Aβ clearance from the brain. Soluble oligomers of Aβ42 isolated from {AD} patients' brains can decrease synapse number, inhibit long‐term potentiation, and enhance long‐term synaptic depression in rodent hippocampus, and injecting them into healthy rats impairs memory. The human oligomers also induce hyperphosphorylation of tau at {AD}‐relevant epitopes and cause neuritic dystrophy in cultured neurons. Crossing human {APP} with human tau transgenic mice enhances tau‐positive neurotoxicity. In humans, new studies show that low cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) Aβ42 and amyloid‐{PET} positivity precede other {AD} manifestations by many years. Most importantly, recent trials of three different Aβ antibodies (solanezumab, crenezumab, and aducanumab) have suggested a slowing of cognitive decline in post hoc analyses of mild {AD} subjects. Although many factors contribute to {AD} pathogenesis, Aβ dyshomeostasis has emerged as the most extensively validated and compelling therapeutic target.},

	abstract = {{APOE}4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}), with increased odds ratios in female carriers. Targeting amyloid plaques shows modest improvement in male non-{APOE}4 carriers. Leveraging single-cell transcriptomics across {APOE} variants in both sexes, multiplex flow cytometry and validation in two independent cohorts of {APOE}4 female carriers with {AD}, we identify a new subset of neutrophils interacting with microglia associated with cognitive impairment. This phenotype is defined by increased interleukin ({IL})-17 and {IL}-1 coexpressed gene modules in blood neutrophils and in microglia of cognitively impaired female {APOE} ε4 carriers, showing increased infiltration to the {AD} brain. {APOE}4 female {IL}-17+ neutrophils upregulated the immunosuppressive cytokines {IL}-10 and {TGFβ} and immune checkpoints, including {LAG}3 and {PD}-1, associated with accelerated immune aging. Deletion of {APOE}4 in neutrophils reduced this immunosuppressive phenotype and restored the microglial response to neurodegeneration, limiting plaque pathology in {AD} mice. Mechanistically, {IL}-17F upregulated in {APOE}4 neutrophils interacts with microglial {IL}-17RA to suppress the induction of the neurodegenerative phenotype, and blocking this axis supported cognitive improvement in {AD} mice. These findings provide a translational basis to target {IL}-17F in {APOE} ε4 female carriers with cognitive impairment.},

	abstract = {Missing values are a genuine issue in label-free quantitative proteomics. Recent works have surveyed the different statistical methods to conduct imputation and have compared them on real or simulated data sets and recommended a list of missing value imputation methods for proteomics application. Although insightful, these comparisons do not account for two important facts: (i) depending on the proteomics data set, the missingness mechanism may be of different natures and (ii) each imputation method is devoted to a specific type of missingness mechanism. As a result, we believe that the question at stake is not to find the most accurate imputation method in general but instead the most appropriate one. We describe a series of comparisons that support our views: For instance, we show that a supposedly “under-performing” method (i.e., giving baseline average results), if applied at the “appropriate” time in the data-processing pipeline (before or after peptide aggregation) on a data set with the “appropriate” nature of missing values, can outperform a blindly applied, supposedly “better-performing” method (i.e., the reference method from the state-of-the-art). This leads us to formulate few practical guidelines regarding the choice and the application of an imputation method in a proteomics context.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease ({AD}), the most common form of dementia in the elderly, has no cure. Thus, the identification of key molecular mediators of cognitive decline in {AD} remains a top priority. As aging is the most significant risk factor for {AD}, the goal of this study was to identify altered proteins and pathways associated with the development of normal aging and {AD} memory deficits, and identify unique proteins and pathways that may contribute to {AD}-specific symptoms. We used contextual fear conditioning to diagnose 8-month-old 5XFAD and non-transgenic (Ntg) mice as having either intact or impaired memory, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}/{MS}) to quantify hippocampal membrane proteins across groups. Subsequent analysis detected 113 proteins differentially expressed relative to memory status (intact vs impaired) in Ntg mice and 103 proteins in 5XFAD mice. Thirty-six proteins, including several involved in neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity (e.g., {GRIA}1, {GRM}3, and {SYN}1), were altered in both normal aging and {AD}. Pathway analysis highlighted {HDAC}4 as a regulator of observed protein changes in both genotypes and identified the {REST} epigenetic regulatory pathway and Gi intracellular signaling as {AD}-specific pathways involved in regulating the onset of memory deficits. Comparing the hippocampal membrane proteome of Ntg versus {AD}, regardless of cognitive status, identified 138 differentially expressed proteins, including confirmatory proteins {APOE} and {CLU}. Overall, we provide a novel list of putative targets and pathways with therapeutic potential, including a set of proteins associated with cognitive status in normal aging mice or gene mutations that cause {AD}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Increasing evidence highlights the importance of novel players in Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) pathophysiology, including alterations of lipid metabolism and neuroinflammation. Indeed, a potential involvement of Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ({PCSK}9) in {AD} has been recently postulated. Here, we first investigated the effects of {PCSK}9 on neuroinflammation in vitro. Then, we examined the impact of a genetic ablation of {PCSK}9 on cognitive performance in a severe mouse model of {AD}. Finally, in the same animals we evaluated the effect of {PCSK}9 loss on Aβ pathology, neuroinflammation, and brain lipids.
{METHODS}: For in vitro studies, U373 human astrocytoma cells were treated with Aβ fibrils and human recombinant {PCSK}9. {mRNA} expression of the proinflammatory cytokines and inflammasome-related genes were evaluated by q-{PCR}, while {MCP}-1 secretion was measured by {ELISA}. For in vivo studies, the cognitive performance of a newly generated mouse line - obtained by crossing 5XFADHet with {PCSK}9KO mice - was tested by the Morris water maze test. After sacrifice, immunohistochemical analyses were performed to evaluate Aβ plaque deposition, distribution and composition, {BACE}1 immunoreactivity, as well as microglia and astrocyte reactivity. Cholesterol and hydroxysterols levels in mouse brains were quantified by fluorometric and {LC}-{MS}/{MS} analyses, respectively. Statistical comparisons were performed according to one- or two-way {ANOVA}, two-way repeated measure {ANOVA} or Chi-square test.
{RESULTS}: In vitro, {PCSK}9 significantly increased {IL}6, {IL}1B and {TNFΑ} {mRNA} levels in Aβ fibrils-treated U373 cells, without influencing inflammasome gene expression, except for an increase in {NLRC}4 {mRNA} levels. In vivo, {PCSK}9 ablation in 5XFAD mice significantly improved the performance at the Morris water maze test; these changes were accompanied by a reduced corticohippocampal Aβ burden without affecting plaque spatial/regional distribution and composition or global {BACE}1 expression. Furthermore, {PCSK}9 loss in 5XFAD mice induced decreased microgliosis and astrocyte reactivity in several brain regions. Conversely, knocking out {PCSK}9 had minimal impact on brain cholesterol and hydroxysterol levels.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In vitro studies showed a pro-inflammatory effect of {PCSK}9. Consistently, in vivo data indicated a protective role of {PCSK}9 ablation against cognitive impairments, associated with improved Aβ pathology and attenuated neuroinflammation in a severe mouse model of {AD}. {PCSK}9 may thus be considered a novel pharmacological target for the treatment of {AD}.},

Imputation has been widely utilized to handle {MVs}, and selection of the proper method is critical for the accuracy and reliability of imputation. Here we present a comparative study that evaluates the performance of seven popular imputation methods with a large-scale benchmark dataset and an immune cell dataset. Simulated {MVs} were incorporated into the complete part of each dataset with different combinations of {MV} rates and missing not at random ({MNAR}) rates. Normalized root mean square error ({NRMSE}) was applied to evaluate the accuracy of protein abundances and intergroup protein ratios after imputation. Detection of true positives ({TPs}) and false altered-protein discovery rate ({FADR}) between groups were also compared using the benchmark dataset. Furthermore, the accuracy of handling real {MVs} was assessed by comparing enriched pathways and signature genes of cell activation after imputing the immune cell dataset. We observed that the accuracy of imputation is primarily affected by the {MNAR} rate rather than the {MV} rate, and downstream analysis can be largely impacted by the selection of imputation methods. A random forest-based imputation method consistently outperformed other popular methods by achieving the lowest {NRMSE}, high amount of {TPs} with the average {FADR} {\textless} 5\%, and the best detection of relevant pathways and signature genes, highlighting it as the most suitable method for label-free proteomics.},

Depletion of {CEND}1 leads to increased mitochondrial fission mediated by upregulation of dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1), resulting in abnormal mitochondrial functions. {CEND}1 deficiency leads to cognitive impairments in mice. Overexpression of {CEND}1 in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice rescued cognitive deficits.

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s Disease ({AD}) is an incurable and debilitating progressive, neurodegenerative disorder which is the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Neuropathologically, {AD} is characterized by the accumulation of Aβ amyloid plaques in the microenvironment of brain cells and neurovascular walls, chronic neuroinflammation, resulting in neuronal and synaptic loss, myelin and axonal failure, as well as significant reduction in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. The hippocampal formation is particularly vulnerable to this degenerative process, due to early dysfunction of the cholinergic circuit. Neurotrophic factors consist major regulatory molecules and their decline in {AD} is considered as an important cause of disease onset and progression. Novel pharmacological approaches are targeting the downstream pathways controlled by neurotrophins, such as nerve growth factor ({NGF}) receptors, {TrkA} and p75NTR, which enhance hippocampal neurogenic capacity and neuroprotective mechanisms, and potentially counteract the neurotoxic effects of amyloid deposition. {BNN}27 is a non-toxic, newly developed 17-spiro-steroid analog, penetrating the blood-brain-barrier ({BBB}) and mimicking the neuroprotective effects of {NGF}, acting as selective activator of its receptors, both {TrkA} and p75NTR, thus promoting survival of various neuronal cell types. Our present research aims at determining whether and which aspects of the {AD}-related pathology, {BNN}27 is able to alleviate, exploring the cellular and molecular {AD} components and link these changes with improvements in the cognitive performance of an animal {AD} model, the 5xFAD mice. Our results clearly indicate that {BNN}27 administration significantly reduced amyloid-β load in whole brain of the animals, enhanced adult hippocampal neurogenesis, restored cholinergic function and synaptogenesis, reducing inflammatory activation and leading to significant restoration of cognitive functions. {BNN}27 may represent a new lead multimodal molecule with neuroprotective, neurogenic and anti-neuroinflammatory actions for developing druggable anti-Alzheimeric agents.

	abstract = {Dystrophic neurites (also termed axonal spheroids) are found around amyloid deposits in Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}), where they impair axonal electrical conduction, disrupt neural circuits and correlate with {AD} severity. Despite their importance, the mechanisms underlying spheroid formation remain incompletely understood. To address this, we developed a proximity labeling approach to uncover the proteome of spheroids in human postmortem and mouse brains. Additionally, we established a human induced pluripotent stem cell ({iPSC})-derived {AD} model enabling mechanistic investigation and optical electrophysiology. These complementary approaches revealed the subcellular molecular architecture of spheroids and identified abnormalities in key biological processes, including protein turnover, cytoskeleton dynamics and lipid transport. Notably, the {PI}3K/{AKT}/{mTOR} pathway, which regulates these processes, was activated in spheroids. Furthermore, phosphorylated {mTOR} levels in spheroids correlated with {AD} severity in humans. Notably, {mTOR} inhibition in {iPSC}-derived neurons and mice ameliorated spheroid pathology. Altogether, our study provides a multidisciplinary toolkit for investigating mechanisms and therapeutic targets for axonal pathology in neurodegeneration.},

	abstract = {Mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) show progression through stages reflective of human pathology. Proteomics identification of temporal and sex-linked factors driving {AD}-related pathways can be used to dissect initiating and propagating events of {AD} stages to develop biomarkers or design interventions. In the present study, we conducted label-free proteome measurements of mouse hippocampus tissue with variables of time (3, 6, and 9 months), genetic background (5XFAD versus {WT}), and sex (equal males and females). These time points are associated with well-defined phenotypes with respect to the following: Aβ42 plaque deposition, memory deficits, and neuronal loss, allowing correlation of proteome-based molecular signatures with the mouse model stages. Our data show 5XFAD mice exhibit increases in known human {AD} biomarkers as amyloid-beta peptide, {APOE}, {GFAP}, and {ITM}2B are upregulated across all time points/stages. At the same time, 23 proteins are here newly associated with Alzheimer’s pathology as they are also dysregulated in 5XFAD mice. At a pathways level, the 5XFAD-specific upregulated proteins are significantly enriched for {DNA} damage and stress-induced senescence at 3-month only, while at 6-month, the {AD}-specific proteome signature is altered and significantly enriched for membrane trafficking and vesicle-mediated transport protein annotations. By 9-month, {AD}-specific dysregulation is also characterized by significant neuroinflammation with innate immune system, platelet activation, and hyper-reactive astrocyte–related enrichments. Aside from these temporal changes, analysis of sex-linked differences in proteome signatures uncovered novel sex and {AD}-associated proteins. Pathway analysis revealed sex-linked differences in the 5XFAD model to be involved in the regulation of well-known human {AD}-related processes of amyloid fibril formation, wound healing, lysosome biogenesis, and {DNA} damage. Verification of the discovery results by Western blot and parallel reaction monitoring confirm the fundamental conclusions of the study and poise the 5XFAD model for further use as a molecular tool for understanding {AD}.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}), which is the most common type of dementia, is characterized by the deposition of extracellular amyloid plaques. To understand the pathophysiology of the {AD} brain, the assessment of global proteomic dynamics is required. Since the hippocampus is a major region affected in the {AD} brain, we performed hippocampal analysis and identified proteins that are differentially expressed between wild-type and 5XFAD model mice via {LC}-{MS} methods. To reveal the relationship between proteomic changes and the progression of amyloid plaque deposition in the hippocampus, we analyzed the hippocampal proteome at two ages (5 and 10 months). We identified 9,313 total proteins and 1411 differentially expressed proteins ({DEPs}) in 5- and 10-month-old wild-type and 5XFAD mice. We designated a group of proteins showing the same pattern of changes as amyloid beta (Aβ) as the Aβ-responsive proteome. In addition, we examined potential biomarkers by investigating secretory proteins from the Aβ-responsive proteome. Consequently, we identified vitamin K-dependent protein S ({PROS}1) as a novel microglia-derived biomarker candidate in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice. Moreover, we confirmed that the {PROS}1 level in the serum of 5XFAD mice increases as the disease progresses. An increase in {PROS}1 is also observed in the sera of {AD} patients and shows a close correlation with {AD} neuroimaging markers in humans. Therefore, our quantitative proteome data obtained from 5XFAD model mice successfully predicted {AD}-related biological alterations and suggested a novel protein biomarker for {AD}.},

Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia in the elderly, is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by a slow but progressive loss of cognitive function. Extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and loss of neurons and synapses resulting in brain atrophy are the main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.1 Disease onset is usually after the age of 70 years, although the prevalence increases exponentially with age after the age of 65 years and exceeds 25\% in those over the age of 90 years.2 The vast majority of variants in the sequence of the genome that have been shown . . .},

In stage 2, we pooled results for these {SNPs} with the European {AD} Initiative (2032 cases and 5328 controls) to identify 38 {SNPs} (10 loci) with P\&lt;10−5. In stage 3, we combined data for these 10 loci with data from the Genetic and Environmental Risk in {AD} consortium (3333 cases and 6995 controls) to identify 4 {SNPs} with P\&lt;1.7×10−8. These 4 {SNPs} were replicated in an independent Spanish sample (1140 {AD} cases and 1209 controls). Genome-wide association analyses were completed in 2007-2008 and the meta-analyses and replication in 2009.Presence of Alzheimer disease.Two loci were identified to have genome-wide significance for the first time: rs744373 near {BIN}1 (odds ratio [{OR}],1.13; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}],1.06-1.21 per copy of the minor allele; P = 1.59×10−11) and rs597668 near {EXOC}3L2/{BLOC}1S3/{MARK}4 ({OR}, 1.18; 95\% {CI}, 1.07-1.29; P = 6.45×10−9). Associations of these 2 loci plus the previously identified loci {CLU} and {PICALM} with {AD} were confirmed in the Spanish sample (P \&lt; .05). However, although {CLU} and {PICALM} were confirmed to be associated with {AD} in this independent sample, they did not improve the ability of a model that included age, sex, and {APOE} to predict incident {AD} (improvement in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.847 to 0.849 in the Rotterdam Study and 0.702 to 0.705 in the Cardiovascular Health Study).Two genetic loci for {AD} were found for the first time to reach genome-wide statistical significance. These findings were replicated in an independent population. Two recently reported associations were also confirmed. These loci did not improve {AD} risk prediction. While not clinically useful, they may implicate biological pathways useful for future research.},

	abstract = {Microglia activation is observed in various neurodegenerative diseases. Recent advances in single-cell technologies have revealed that these reactive microglia were with high spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Some identified microglia in specific states correlate with pathological hallmarks and are associated with specific functions. Microglia both exert protective function by phagocytosing and clearing pathological protein aggregates and play detrimental roles due to excessive uptake of protein aggregates, which would lead to microglial phagocytic ability impairment, neuroinflammation, and eventually neurodegeneration. In addition, peripheral immune cells infiltration shapes microglia into a pro-inflammatory phenotype and accelerates disease progression. Microglia also act as a mobile vehicle to propagate protein aggregates. Extracellular vesicles released from microglia and autophagy impairment in microglia all contribute to pathological progression and neurodegeneration. Thus, enhancing microglial phagocytosis, reducing microglial-mediated neuroinflammation, inhibiting microglial exosome synthesis and secretion, and promoting microglial conversion into a protective phenotype are considered to be promising strategies for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we comprehensively review the biology of microglia and the roles of microglia in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies and Huntington’s disease. We also summarize the possible microglia-targeted interventions and treatments against neurodegenerative diseases with preclinical and clinical evidence in cell experiments, animal studies, and clinical trials.},

Approximately half the diffuse deposits had no human leukocyte antigen ({HLA})-{DR}-positive reactive microglia associated with them while nearly all compact deposits had single or multiple {HLA}-{DR}-positive reactive microglia embedded in their core.

	abstract = {The specific function of microglia, the tissue resident macrophages of the brain and spinal cord, has been difficult to ascertain because of a lack of tools to distinguish microglia from other immune cells, thereby limiting specific immunostaining, purification, and manipulation. Because of their unique developmental origins and predicted functions, the distinction of microglia from other myeloid cells is critically important for understanding brain development and disease; better tools would greatly facilitate studies of microglia function in the developing, adult, and injured {CNS}. Here, we identify transmembrane protein 119 (Tmem119), a cell-surface protein of unknown function, as a highly expressed microglia-specific marker in both mouse and human. We developed monoclonal antibodies to its intracellular and extracellular domains that enable the immunostaining of microglia in histological sections in healthy and diseased brains, as well as isolation of pure nonactivated microglia by {FACS}. Using our antibodies, we provide, to our knowledge, the first {RNAseq} profiles of highly pure mouse microglia during development and after an immune challenge. We used these to demonstrate that mouse microglia mature by the second postnatal week and to predict novel microglial functions. Together, we anticipate these resources will be valuable for the future study and understanding of microglia in health and disease.},

We found that the majority of adult microglia expressing homeostatic genes are remarkably similar in transcriptomes, regardless of brain region. By contrast, early postnatal microglia are more heterogeneous. We discovered a proliferative-region-associated microglia ({PAM}) subset, mainly found in developing white matter, that shares a characteristic gene signature with degenerative disease-associated microglia ({DAM}). Such {PAM} have amoeboid morphology, are metabolically active, and phagocytose newly formed oligodendrocytes.

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) is characterized by extracellular aggregates of amyloid β peptides, intraneuronal tau aggregates, and neuronal death. This pathology triggers activation of microglia. Because variants of genes expressed in microglia correlate with {AD} risk, microglial response to pathology plausibly impacts disease course. In mouse {AD} models, single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) analyses delineated this response as progressive conversion of homeostatic microglia into disease-associated microglia ({DAM}); additional reactive microglial populations have been reported in other models of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. We review all of these microglial signatures, highlighting four fundamental patterns: {DAM}, {IFN}–microglia, {MHC}-{II} microglia, and proliferating microglia. We propose that all reported microglia populations are either just one or a combination, depending on the clustering strategy applied and the disease model. We further review single-nucleus {RNA} sequencing ({snRNA}-seq) data from human {AD} specimens and discuss reasons for parallels and discrepancies between human and mouse transcriptional profiles. Finally, we outline future directions for delineating the microglial impact in {AD} pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {The genetic origin of the three common variants of the human apolipoprotein E ({apoE}) protein, known as E2, E3 and E4, was understood in 1981, and since the mid 1980s these are probably the most-studied protein variants in human races. They have been related to a number of age-related diseases, including Alzheimer disease, as well as to healthy aging and longevity. The gene variants underlying these protein isoforms, known as ε2, ε3, and ε4, are allelic forms of the {APOE} gene, resulting from different haplotypes at the {APOE} locus (19q13.31). In particular, they result from three of the four haplotypes expected by the combinations of the alleles of the two single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs429358 and rs7412. The fourth missing haplotype, known as ε3r, has been identified in only two Caucasian families from Italy and in one Yoruba family from Nigeria worldwide. Thus, this fourth {APOE} gene variant is rare, and it encodes a protein isoform, identified as E3r, showing identical physical characteristics to E3, that conversely, is the most common form of {apoE} in humans. In this review article, we report the identification of the haplotype ε3r in a third Caucasian family from Italy, and then attempt to re-examine the current knowledge regarding the {APOE} polymorphism, taking into account this fourth haplotype. We also focus on the commonly accepted hypothesis for the evolution of the common {APOE} gene variants, in which we include the ε3r haplotype, previously not considered.},

	abstract = {Background
To assess the effects of apolipoprotein E ({ApoE}) ε4 genotype on amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau burden and their longitudinal changes in Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) spectrum.

Methods
Among 272 individuals who underwent {PET} scans (18F-florbetaben for Aβ and 18F-flortaucipir for tau) and {ApoE} genotyping, 187 individuals completed 2-year follow-up {PET} scans. After correcting for the partial volume effect, we compared the standardized uptake value ratio ({SUVR}) for Aβ and tau burden between the ε4+ and ε4− groups. By using a linear mixed-effect model, we measured changes in {SUVR} in the {ApoE} ε4+ and ε4− groups.

Results
The ε4+ group showed greater baseline Aβ burden in the diffuse cortical regions and greater tau burden in the lateral, and medial temporal, cingulate, and insula cortices. Tau accumulation rate was higher in the parietal, occipital, lateral, and medial temporal cortices in the ε4+ group. In Aβ+ individuals, baseline tau burden was greater in the medial temporal cortex, while Aβ burden was conversely greater in the ε4− group. Tau accumulation rate was higher in the ε4+ group in a small region in the lateral temporal cortex. The effect of {ApoE} ε4 on enhanced tau accumulation persisted even after adjusting for the global cortical Aβ burden.

Conclusions
Progressive tau accumulation may be more prominent in ε4 carriers, particularly in the medial and lateral temporal cortices. {ApoE} ε4 allele has differential effects on the Aβ burden depending on the existing amyloidosis and may enhance vulnerability to progressive tau accumulation in the {AD} spectrum independent of Aβ.

	abstract = {Introduction:
Alzheimer apolipoprotein E ({APOE}) ε4/ε4 carriers have earlier disease onset and more protein aggregates than patients with other {APOE} genotypes. Autophagy opposes aggregation, and important autophagy genes are coordinately regulated by transcription factor {EB} ({TFEB}) binding to “coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation” ({CLEAR}) {DNA} motifs.

Methods:
Autophagic gene expression was assessed in brains of controls and Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) patients parsed by {APOE} genotype and in a glioblastoma cell line expressing either {apoE}3 or {apoE}4. Computational modeling assessed interactions between {apoE} and mutated {apoE} with {CLEAR} or modified {DNA}.

Results:
Three {TFEB}-regulated {mRNA} transcripts—{SQSTM}, {MAP}1LC3B, and {LAMP}2—were lower in {AD} ε4/ε4 than in {AD} ε3/ε3 brains. Computational modeling predicted avid specific binding of {apoE}4 to {CLEAR} motifs. {ApoE} was found in cellular nuclei, and in vitro binding assays suggest competition between {apoE}4 and {TFEB} at {CLEAR} sites.

Conclusion:
{ApoE}4-{CLEAR} interactions may account for suppressed autophagy in {APOE} ε4/ε4 carriers and, in this way, contribute to earlier {AD} onset.},

	abstract = {This study examined the effects of apolipoprotein E4 ({APOE}4), the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}), on proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy, in the hippocampus of targeted replacement mice. Immunohistochemical measurements revealed that the levels of the mitochondrial fusion-mediating protein, {MFN}1, were higher, whereas those of corresponding fission-regulating protein, {DRP}-1, were lower in the hippocampus of {ApoE}4 mice than in the corresponding {ApoE}3 mice, indicating that {APOE}4 is associated with increased mitochondrial fusion and decreased fission. A similar {ApoE}4-driven decrease in {DRP}-1 was also observed in {AD} brains. The levels of the mitochondrial proteins {COX}1 and Tom40, were higher in the {ApoE}4 mice, which is consistent with the increased fusion. Measurements of the levels of cleaved {PINK}1 and parkin, which mark and target mitochondria for mitophagic degradation, revealed lower levels of cleaved {PINK}1, suggesting reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and higher levels of parkin in the hippocampus of {ApoE}4 compared with the {ApoE}3 mice, indicating altered mitophagy. The levels of the ubiquitin-binding scaffold protein, p62/{SQSTM}1, which directs selected cargo to the autophagosomes, were also higher in the {ApoE}4 mice. These findings suggest that {APOE}4 is associated with enhanced mitochondrial fusion and decreased fission. Additionally, the results indicate that mitophagy/autophagy is reduced in {ApoE}4 mice, resulting in higher levels of proteins such as parkin and p62, which are normally degraded during this process. Taken together, these results suggest a novel mechanism that may underlie the pathological effects of {APOE}4 and indicate that use of {APOE}4 genotyping could pave the way for identification of novel {APOE}4-related therapeutic targets.},

	abstract = {The apolipoprotein E ({APOE}) ε4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset, sporadic Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}). The {APOE} ε4 allele dramatically increases {AD} risk and decreases age of onset, likely through its strong effect on the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. In contrast, the {APOE} ε2 allele appears to decrease {AD} risk. Most rare, early-onset forms of familial {AD} are caused by autosomal dominant mutations that often lead to overproduction of Aβ42 peptide. However, the mechanism by which {APOE} alleles differentially modulate Aβ accumulation in sporadic, late-onset {AD} is less clear. In a cohort of cognitively normal individuals, we report that reliable molecular and neuroimaging biomarkers of cerebral Aβ deposition vary in an {apoE} isoform-dependent manner. We hypothesized that human {apoE} isoforms differentially affect Aβ clearance or synthesis in vivo, resulting in an {apoE} isoform-dependent pattern of Aβ accumulation later in life. Performing in vivo microdialysis in a mouse model of β-amyloidosis expressing human {apoE} isoforms ({PDAPP}/{TRE}), we find that the concentration and clearance of soluble Aβ in the brain interstitial fluid depends on the isoform of {apoE} expressed. This pattern parallels the extent of Aβ deposition observed in aged {PDAPP}/{TRE} mice. Importantly, {apoE} isoform-dependent differences in soluble Aβ metabolism are observed not only in aged {PDAPP}/{TRE} mice but also in young {PDAPP}/{TRE} mice, well before the onset of Aβ deposition in amyloid plaques. Additionally, amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein and Aβ synthesis, as assessed by in vivo stable isotopic labeling kinetics, do not vary according to {apoE} isoform in young {PDAPP}/{TRE} mice. Our results suggest that {APOE} alleles contribute to {AD} risk by differentially regulating clearance of Aβ from the brain, suggesting that Aβ clearance pathways may be useful therapeutic targets for {AD} prevention.},

	abstract = {Microglia have an innate immunity memory ({IIM}) with divergent functions in different animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}). {AD} is characterized by chronic neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, tau tangles and β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition. Systemic inflammation has been implicated in contributing to the progression of {AD}. Multiple reports have demonstrated unique microglial signatures in {AD} mouse models and patients. However, the proteomic profiles of microglia modified by {IIM} have not been well-documented in an {AD} model. Therefore, in the present study, we investigate whether lipopolysaccharide ({LPS})-induced {IIM} in the pre-clinical stage of {AD} alters the microglial responses and shapes the neuropathology. We accomplished this by priming 5xFAD and wild-type ({WT}) mice with an {LPS} injection at 6 weeks (before the robust development of plaques). 140 days later, we evaluated microglial morphology, activation, the microglial barrier around Aβ, and Aβ deposition in both 5xFAD primed and unprimed mice. Priming induced decreased soma size of microglia and reduced colocalization of {PSD}95 and Synaptophysin in the retrosplenial cortex. Priming appeared to increase phagocytosis of Aβ, resulting in fewer Thioflavin S+ Aβ fibrils in the dentate gyrus. {RIPA}-soluble Aβ 40 and 42 were significantly reduced in Primed-5xFAD mice leading to a smaller size of {MOAB}2+ Aβ plaques in the prefrontal cortex. We also found that Aβ-associated microglia in the Primed-5xFAD mice were less activated and fewer in number. After priming, we also observed improved memory performance in 5xFAD. To further elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying these changes, we performed quantitative proteomic analysis of microglia and bone marrow monocytes. A specific pattern in the microglial proteome was revealed in primed 5xFAD mice. These results suggest that the imprint signatures of primed microglia display a distinctive phenotype and highlight the potential for a beneficial adaption of microglia when intervention occurs in the pre-clinical stage of {AD}.},

Depending on the initial stimulus, {IIM} can either enhance or suppress microglial responses to a delayed, secondary insult. Moreover, both priming and {IIM} can affect pathological hallmarks of neurological disease in mouse models, which may be consistent with certain clinical observations in patients.

The disparity between m- and h-{apoE} is relevant for virtually every {AD}-relevant pathway, including amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition and clearance, neuroinflammation, tau pathology, neural plasticity and cerebrovascular deficits. {EFAD} mice were designed as a temporally useful preclinical {FAD}-Tg-mouse model expressing the h-{APOE} genotypes for identifying mechanisms underlying {APOE}-modulated symptoms of {AD} pathology. From their first description in 2012, {EFAD} mice have enabled critical basic and therapeutic research. Here we review insights gleaned from the {EFAD} mice and summarize future directions.},

The transcriptional factor nuclear factor-κB ({NF}-κB) drives astrocyte diversity, but the mechanisms are not fully understood. By combining studies in human brains and animal models and selectively manipulating {NF}-κB function in astrocytes, we deepened the understanding of the role of astrocytic {NF}-κB in brain health and {AD}. In silico analysis of bulk and cell-specific transcriptomic data revealed the association of {NF}-κB and astrocytes in {AD}. Confocal studies validated the higher level of p50 {NF}-κB and phosphorylated-p65 {NF}-κB in glial fibrillary acidic protein ({GFAP})+-astrocytes in {AD} versus non-{AD} subjects. In the healthy mouse brain, chronic activation of astrocytic {NF}-κB disturbed the proteomic milieu, causing a loss of mitochondrial-associated proteins and the rise of inflammatory-related proteins. Sustained {NF}-κB signaling also led to microglial reactivity, production of pro-inflammatory mediators, and buildup of senescence-related protein p16INK4A in neurons. However, in an {AD} mouse model, {NF}-κB inhibition accelerated β-amyloid and tau accumulation. Molecular biology studies revealed that astrocytic {NF}-κB activation drives the increase in {GFAP} and inflammatory proteins and aquaporin-4, a glymphatic system protein that assists in mitigating {AD}. Our investigation uncovered fundamental mechanisms by which {NF}-κB enables astrocytes' neuroprotective and neurotoxic responses in the brain.},

How these different pathologies contribute to advanced-stage {AD} remains unclear.

Here, we used various experimental approaches to delineate the transcriptional landscape of microglia during viral infection. Intriguingly, multiple activation genes were found to be artificially induced in sorted microglia and we demonstrated that shear stress encountered during cell sorting was one of the key inducers. Post-hoc analysis revealed that publicly available large-scale single-cell {RNA} sequencing datasets were significantly tainted by aberrant signatures that are associated with cell sorting. By exploiting the ribosomal tagging approach, we developed a strategy to enrich microglia-specific transcripts by comparing immunoprecipitated {RNA} with total {RNA}. Such enriched transcripts were instrumental in defining bona fide signatures of microglia under conditions of health and virus infection. These unified microglial signatures may serve as a benchmark to retrospectively assess ex vivo artefacts from available atlases. Leveraging the microglial translatome, we found enrichment of genes implicated in T-cell activation and cytokine production during the course of {VSV} infection. These data linked microglia with T-cell re-stimulation and further underscored that microglia are involved in shaping antiviral T-cell responses in the brain. Collectively, our study defines the transcriptional landscape of microglia under steady state and during viral encephalitis and highlights cellular interactions between microglia and T cells that contribute to the control of virus dissemination.},

Mice transgenic for mutant human amyloid precursor protein ({APP}) develop progressive amyloid deposition, gliosis, and cognitive impairment. Paradoxically, intracranial administration of lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}) to promote neuroinflammation results in a reduction in amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) burden concurrent with the inflammatory response. To determine whether microglia mediate Aβ clearance after {LPS}, we used dexamethasone to inhibit the microglial response. Amyloid precursor protein mice were injected intrahippocampally with either {LPS} or saline and were allowed to survive for 7 days with or without dexamethasone cotreatment. Brain tissue was then analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Hippocampal Aβ burden was reduced 7 days after {LPS} injection, and this was prevented by cotreatment with dexamethasone. Markers of microglial activation [{CD}45, complement receptor 3 ({CR}3), and macrosialin ({CD}68)] were increased by {LPS}, and these increases were attenuated by dexamethasone. Dexamethasone failed to block {LPS}-induced increases in all microglial markers, and Fcγ receptors {II}/{III} and scavenger receptor A were increased by {LPS} but were unaffected by dexamethasone cotreatment. These results indicate a complex response by microglia to acute {LPS} treatment, with only some responses sensitive to steroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment. Nonetheless, microglial activation was necessary to remove Aβ in this model of neuroinflammation.},

In patients with Alzheimer's disease, deposition of amyloid-β is accompanied by activation of the innate immune system and involves inflammasome-dependent formation of {ASC} specks in microglia. {ASC} specks released by microglia bind rapidly to amyloid-β and increase the formation of amyloid-β oligomers and aggregates, acting as an inflammation-driven cross-seed for amyloid-β pathology. Here we show that intrahippocampal injection of {ASC} specks resulted in spreading of amyloid-β pathology in transgenic double-mutant {APPSwePSEN}1dE9 mice. By contrast, homogenates from brains of {APPSwePSEN}1dE9 mice failed to induce seeding and spreading of amyloid-β pathology in {ASC}-deficient {APPSwePSEN}1dE9 mice. Moreover, co-application of an anti-{ASC} antibody blocked the increase in amyloid-β pathology in {APPSwePSEN}1dE9 mice. These findings support the concept that inflammasome activation is connected to seeding and spreading of amyloid-β pathology in patients with Alzheimer's disease.},

	abstract = {The ϵ4 allele of the apolipoprotein E ({APOE}) gene is associated with increased cholesterol levels and heart disease. Population allele frequencies of {APOE} have previously been shown to vary, with ϵ4 frequencies generally increasing with latitude. We hypothesize that this trend resulted from natural selection protecting against low-cholesterol levels. In high-latitude cold environments and low-latitude hot environments, metabolic rate is elevated, which could require higher cholesterol levels. To explore this hypothesis, we compiled {APOE} allele frequencies, latitude, temperature, and elevation from populations around the world. ϵ4 allele frequencies show a curvilinear relationship with absolute latitude, with lowest frequencies found in the mid-latitudes where temperatures generally require less expenditure on cooling/thermogenesis. Controlling for population structure in a subset of populations did not appreciably change this pattern of association, consistent with selection pressures that vary by latitude shaping ϵ4 allele frequencies. Temperature records also predict {APOE} frequency in a curvilinear fashion, with lowest ϵ4 frequencies at moderate temperatures. The model fit between historical temperatures and ϵ4 is less than between latitude and ϵ4, but strengthened after correcting for estimated temperature differences during the Paleolithic. Contrary to our hypothesis, we find that elevation did not improve predictive power, and an integrated measure of the cholesterol effect of multiple {APOE} alleles was less related to latitude than was ϵ4 alone. Our results lend mixed support for a link between past temperature and human {APOE} allele distribution and point to the need to develop better models of past climate in future analyses.

To assess the effects of apolipoprotein E ({ApoE}) ε4 genotype on amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau burden and their longitudinal changes in Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) spectrum.

Methods
Among 272 individuals who underwent {PET} scans (18F-florbetaben for Aβ and 18F-flortaucipir for tau) and {ApoE} genotyping, 187 individuals completed 2-year follow-up {PET} scans. After correcting for the partial volume effect, we compared the standardized uptake value ratio ({SUVR}) for Aβ and tau burden between the ε4+ and ε4− groups. By using a linear mixed-effect model, we measured changes in {SUVR} in the {ApoE} ε4+ and ε4− groups.

Results
The ε4+ group showed greater baseline Aβ burden in the diffuse cortical regions and greater tau burden in the lateral, and medial temporal, cingulate, and insula cortices. Tau accumulation rate was higher in the parietal, occipital, lateral, and medial temporal cortices in the ε4+ group. In Aβ+ individuals, baseline tau burden was greater in the medial temporal cortex, while Aβ burden was conversely greater in the ε4− group. Tau accumulation rate was higher in the ε4+ group in a small region in the lateral temporal cortex. The effect of {ApoE} ε4 on enhanced tau accumulation persisted even after adjusting for the global cortical Aβ burden.

Conclusions
Progressive tau accumulation may be more prominent in ε4 carriers, particularly in the medial and lateral temporal cortices. {ApoE} ε4 allele has differential effects on the Aβ burden depending on the existing amyloidosis and may enhance vulnerability to progressive tau accumulation in the {AD} spectrum independent of Aβ.

	abstract = {Mutations in the genes for amyloid precursor protein ({APP}) and presenilins ({PS}1, {PS}2) increase production of β-amyloid 42 (Aβ42) and cause familial Alzheimer's disease ({FAD}). Transgenic mice that express {FAD} mutant {APP} and {PS}1 overproduce Aβ42 and exhibit amyloid plaque pathology similar to that found in {AD}, but most transgenic models develop plaques slowly. To accelerate plaque development and investigate the effects of very high cerebral Aβ42 levels, we generated {APP}/{PS}1 double transgenic mice that coexpress five {FAD} mutations (5XFAD mice) and additively increase Aβ42 production. 5XFAD mice generate Aβ42 almost exclusively and rapidly accumulate massive cerebral Aβ42 levels. Amyloid deposition (and gliosis) begins at 2 months and reaches a very large burden, especially in subiculum and deep cortical layers. Intraneuronal Aβ42 accumulates in 5XFAD brain starting at 1.5 months of age (before plaques form), is aggregated (as determined by thioflavin S staining), and occurs within neuron soma and neurites. Some amyloid deposits originate within morphologically abnormal neuron soma that contain intraneuronal Aβ. Synaptic markers synaptophysin, syntaxin, and postsynaptic density-95 decrease with age in 5XFAD brain, and large pyramidal neurons in cortical layer 5 and subiculum are lost. In addition, levels of the activation subunit of cyclin-dependent kinase 5, p25, are elevated significantly at 9 months in 5XFAD brain, although an upward trend is observed by 3 months of age, before significant neurodegeneration or neuron loss. Finally, 5XFAD mice have impaired memory in the Y-maze. Thus, 5XFAD mice rapidly recapitulate major features of {AD} amyloid pathology and may be useful models of intraneuronal Aβ42-induced neurodegeneration and amyloid plaque formation.},

Two types of immunological imprinting can be distinguished—training and tolerance. These are epigenetically mediated and enhance or suppress subsequent inflammation, respectively. Whether immune memory occurs in tissue-resident macrophages in vivo and how it may affect pathology remains largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that peripherally applied inflammatory stimuli induce acute immune training and tolerance in the brain and lead to differential epigenetic reprogramming of brain-resident macrophages (microglia) that persists for at least six months. Strikingly, in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s pathology, immune training exacerbates cerebral β-amyloidosis and immune tolerance alleviates it; similarly, peripheral immune stimulation modifies pathological features after stroke. Our results identify immune memory in the brain as an important modifier of neuropathology.},

Methods that ignore this inevitable variation are biased and prone to false discoveries. Indeed, the most widely used methods can discover hundreds of differentially expressed genes in the absence of biological differences.

We leveraged post mortem data from 1453 persons who participated in one of two longitudinal community-based studies of older adults, the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Postmortem examination identified {AD} pathologies, neocortical Lewy bodies, {DNA}-binding protein 43 ({TDP}-43), hippocampal sclerosis, gross and micro infarcts, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Linear and logistic regressions examined the association of sex with each of the pathologic measures. Two thirds of subjects were women (n=971; 67\%), with a mean age-at-death of 89.8 ({SD}=6.6) years in women and 87.3 ({SD}=6.6) in men. Adjusted for age and education, women had higher levels on a global measure of {AD} pathology (estimate=0.102, {SE}=0.022, p{\textless}0.001), and tau tangle density in particular (estimate=0.334, {SE}=0.074, p{\textless}0.001), and there was a borderline difference between women and men in amyloid-β load (estimate=0.124, {SE}=0.065, p=0.056). In addition, compared to men, women were more likely to have more severe arteriolosclerosis ({OR}=1.28, 95\% {CI}:1.04–1.58, p=0.018), and less likely to have gross infarcts ({OR}=0.78, 95\% {CI}:0.61–0.98, p=0.037), although the association with gross infarct was attenuated after controlling for vascular risk factors.

	abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput {PCR} data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for {RNA}-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both {RNA}-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

	abstract = {Competitive gene set tests are commonly used in molecular pathway analysis to test for enrichment of a particular gene annotation category amongst the differential expression results from a microarray experiment. Existing gene set tests that rely on gene permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model organisms. A new gene set test procedure ({CAMERA}) is proposed based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene correlation and characterizing its precision. {CAMERA} is shown to control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows that {CAMERA} recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes in very convincing terms. {CAMERA} can be used to analyze specified sets or as a pathway analysis tool using a database of molecular signatures.},
