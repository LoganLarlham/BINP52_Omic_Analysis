	abstract = {The advent of high-throughput single-cell transcriptomic analysis of microglia has revealed different phenotypes that are inherently associated with disease conditions. A common feature of some of these activated phenotypes is the upregulation of galectin-3. Representative examples of these phenotypes include disease-associated microglia ({DAM}) and white-associated microglia ({WAM}), whose role(s) in neuroprotection/neurotoxicity is a matter of high interest in the microglia community. In this review, we summarise the main findings that demonstrate the ability of galectin-3 to interact with key pattern recognition receptors, including, among others, {TLR}4 and {TREM}2 and the importance of galectin-3 in the regulation of microglia activation. Finally, we discuss increasing evidence supporting the involvement of this lectin in the main neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and stroke.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) is a detrimental neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatments. Due to cellular heterogeneity, defining the roles of immune cell subsets in {AD} onset and progression has been challenging. Using transcriptional single-cell sorting, we comprehensively map all immune populations in wild-type and {AD}-transgenic (Tg-{AD}) mouse brains. We describe a novel microglia type associated with neurodegenerative diseases ({DAM}) and identify markers, spatial localization, and pathways associated with these cells. Immunohistochemical staining of mice and human brain slices shows {DAM} with intracellular/phagocytic Aβ particles. Single-cell analysis of {DAM} in Tg-{AD} and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2)−/− Tg-{AD} reveals that the {DAM} program is activated in a two-step process. Activation is initiated in a Trem2-independent manner that involves downregulation of microglia checkpoints, followed by activation of a Trem2-dependent program. This unique microglia-type has the potential to restrict neurodegeneration, which may have important implications for future treatment of {AD} and other neurodegenerative diseases.

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) is the most common form of dementia characterized by the formation of amyloid plaques (Aβ). Over the last decade, the important role of the innate immune system for the disease development has been established. Chronic activation of microglial cells creates a proinflammatory environment, which is believed to be central for the development of the disease as well as its progression. We used the {AD} mouse model 5xFAD to investigate if inflammatory alterations are present in microglial cells before plaque deposition. We applied mass spectrometry and bioinformation analysis to elucidate early microglial alterations. Interestingly, we found the cytokines {IL}1β and {IL}10 to be elevated in the 5xFAD brain after the formation of Aβ plaque at 10 weeks only. Using mass spectrometry analysis of microglial cells with bioinformation analysis, we found {JAK}/{STAT}, p38 {MAPK} and Interleukin pathways affected in microglial cells before plaque deposition at 6 weeks. At 10 weeks, {GO} analysis showed affected pathways related to interferon-gamma regulation and {MAPK} pathways. Our study points toward early inflammatory changes in microglial cells even before the accumulation of Aβ.},

	abstract = {{ApoE} is the major lipid and cholesterol carrier in the {CNS}. There are three major human polymorphisms, {apoE}2, {apoE}3, and {apoE}4, and the genetic expression of {APOE}4 is one of the most influential risk factors for the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease ({AD}). Neuroinflammation has become the third hallmark of {AD}, together with Amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated aggregated tau protein. This review aims to broadly and extensively describe the differential aspects concerning {apoE}. Starting from the evolution of {apoE} to how {APOE}'s single-nucleotide polymorphisms affect its structure, function, and involvement during health and disease. This review reflects on how {APOE}'s polymorphisms impact critical aspects of {AD} pathology, such as the neuroinflammatory response, particularly the effect of {APOE} on astrocytic and microglial function and microglial dynamics, synaptic function, amyloid-β load, tau pathology, autophagy, and cell–cell communication. We discuss influential factors affecting {AD} pathology combined with the {APOE} genotype, such as sex, age, diet, physical exercise, current therapies and clinical trials in the {AD} field. The impact of the {APOE} genotype in other neurodegenerative diseases characterized by overt inflammation, e.g., alpha- synucleinopathies and Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis, is also addressed. Therefore, this review gathers the most relevant findings related to the {APOE} genotype up to date and its implications on {AD} and {CNS} pathologies to provide a deeper understanding of the knowledge in the {APOE} field.},

	abstract = {Droplet-based 3’ single-cell {RNA}-sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) methods have proved transformational in characterizing cellular diversity and generating valuable hypotheses throughout biology1,2. Here we outline a common problem with 3’ {scRNA}-seq datasets where genes that have been documented to be expressed with other methods, are either completely missing or are dramatically under-represented thereby compromising the discovery of cell types, states, and genetic mechanisms. We show that this problem stems from three main sources of sequencing read loss: (1) reads mapping immediately 3’ to known gene boundaries due to poor 3’ {UTR} annotation; (2) intronic reads stemming from unannotated exons or pre-{mRNA}; (3) discarded reads due to gene overlaps3. Each of these issues impacts the detection of thousands of genes even in well-characterized mouse and human genomes rendering downstream analysis either partially or fully blind to their expression. We outline a simple three-step solution to recover the missing gene expression data that entails compiling a hybrid pre-{mRNA} reference to retrieve intronic reads4, resolving gene collision derived read loss through removal of readthrough and premature start transcripts, and redefining 3’ gene boundaries to capture false intergenic reads. We demonstrate with mouse brain and human peripheral blood datasets that this approach dramatically increases the amount of sequencing data included in downstream analysis revealing 20 - 50\% more genes per cell and incorporates 15-20\% more sequencing reads than with standard solutions5. These improvements reveal previously missing biologically relevant cell types, states, and marker genes in the mouse brain and human blood profiling data. Finally, we provide {scRNA}-seq optimized transcriptomic references for human and mouse data as well as simple algorithmic implementation of these solutions that can be deployed to both thoroughly as well as poorly annotated genomes. Our results demonstrate that optimizing the sequencing read mapping step can significantly improve the analysis resolution as well as biological insight from {scRNA}-seq. Moreover, this approach warrants a fresh look at preceding analyses of this popular and scalable cellular profiling technology.},

They fulfill multiple functions across development and adulthood and under disease conditions. Current understanding revolves around microglia acquiring distinct phenotypes upon exposure to extrinsic cues in their environment. However, emerging evidence suggests that microglia display differences in their functions that are not exclusively driven by their milieu, rather by the unique properties these cells possess. This microglial intrinsic heterogeneity has been largely overlooked, favoring the prevailing view that microglia are a single‐cell type endowed with spectacular plasticity, allowing them to acquire multiple phenotypes and thereby fulfill their numerous functions in health and disease. Here, we review the evidence that microglia might form a community of cells in which each member (or “subtype”) displays intrinsic properties and performs unique functions. Distinctive features and functional implications of several microglial subtypes are considered, across contexts of health and disease. Finally, we suggest that microglial subtype categorization shall be based on function and we propose ways for studying them. Hence, we advocate that plasticity (reaction states) and diversity (subtypes) should both be considered when studying the multitasking microglia.},

Across six major brain cell types, we identified transcriptionally distinct subpopulations, including those associated with pathology and characterized by regulators of myelination, inflammation, and neuron survival. The strongest disease-associated changes appeared early in pathological progression and were highly cell-type specific, whereas genes upregulated at late stages were common across cell types and primarily involved in the global stress response. Notably, we found that female cells were overrepresented in disease-associated subpopulations, and that transcriptional responses were substantially different between sexes in several cell types, including oligodendrocytes. Overall, myelination-related processes were recurrently perturbed in multiple cell types, suggesting that myelination has a key role in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.

The greatest microglial heterogeneity was found at young ages; however, several states—including chemokine-enriched inflammatory microglia—persisted throughout the lifespan or increased in the aged brain. Multiple reactive microglial subtypes were also found following demyelinating injury in mice, at least one of which was also found in human multiple sclerosis lesions.

We identified a specific apolipoprotein E ({APOE})-dependent molecular signature in microglia from models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS}), multiple sclerosis ({MS}), and Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) and in microglia surrounding neuritic β-amyloid (Aβ)-plaques in the brains of people with {AD}. The {APOE} pathway mediated a switch from a homeostatic to a neurodegenerative microglia phenotype after phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons. {TREM}2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) induced {APOE} signaling, and targeting the {TREM}2-{APOE} pathway restored the homeostatic signature of microglia in {ALS} and {AD} mouse models and prevented neuronal loss in an acute model of neurodegeneration. {APOE}-mediated neurodegenerative microglia had lost their tolerogenic function. Our work identifies the {TREM}2-{APOE} pathway as a major regulator of microglial functional phenotype in neurodegenerative diseases and serves as a novel target that could aid in the restoration of homeostatic microglia.},

	abstract = {The mammalian brain consists of millions to billions of cells that are organized into many cell types with specific spatial distribution patterns and structural and functional properties1–3. Here we report a comprehensive and high-resolution transcriptomic and spatial cell-type atlas for the whole adult mouse brain. The cell-type atlas was created by combining a single-cell {RNA}-sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) dataset of around 7 million cells profiled (approximately 4.0 million cells passing quality control), and a spatial transcriptomic dataset of approximately 4.3 million cells using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization ({MERFISH}). The atlas is hierarchically organized into 4 nested levels of classification: 34 classes, 338 subclasses, 1,201 supertypes and 5,322 clusters. We present an online platform, Allen Brain Cell Atlas, to visualize the mouse whole-brain cell-type atlas along with the single-cell {RNA}-sequencing and {MERFISH} datasets. We systematically analysed the neuronal and non-neuronal cell types across the brain and identified a high degree of correspondence between transcriptomic identity and spatial specificity for each cell type. The results reveal unique features of cell-type organization in different brain regions—in particular, a dichotomy between the dorsal and ventral parts of the brain. The dorsal part contains relatively fewer yet highly divergent neuronal types, whereas the ventral part contains more numerous neuronal types that are more closely related to each other. Our study also uncovered extraordinary diversity and heterogeneity in neurotransmitter and neuropeptide expression and co-expression patterns in different cell types. Finally, we found that transcription factors are major determinants of cell-type classification and identified a combinatorial transcription factor code that defines cell types across all parts of the brain. The whole mouse brain transcriptomic and spatial cell-type atlas establishes a benchmark reference atlas and a foundational resource for integrative investigations of cellular and circuit function, development and evolution of the mammalian brain.},

Aβ plaques had more differentially expressed genes than tangles. We identified a gradient Aβ plaque {\textgreater} peri-plaque {\textgreater} tangle {\textgreater} distant for these changes. {AD} {APOE} ε4 homozygotes had greater changes than {APOE} ε3 across locations, especially within Aβ plaques. {DISCUSSION} Transcriptomic changes in {AD} consist primarily of neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction, are spatially associated mainly with Aβ plaques, and are exacerbated by the {APOE} ε4 allele.},

One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

Activated response microglia ({ARMs}) are composed of specialized subgroups overexpressing {MHC} type {II} and putative tissue repair genes (Dkk2, Gpnmb, and Spp1) and are strongly enriched with Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) risk genes. Microglia from female mice progress faster in this activation trajectory. Similar activated states are also found in a second {AD} model and in human brain. Apoe, the major genetic risk factor for {AD}, regulates the {ARMs} but not the interferon response microglia ({IRMs}).

	abstract = {Single-cell {RNA}-sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) is a recent high-throughput sequencing technique for studying gene expressions at the cell level. Differential Expression ({DE}) analysis is a major downstream analysis of {scRNA}-seq data. {DE} analysis the in presence of noises from different sources remains a key challenge in {scRNA}-seq. Earlier practices for addressing this involved borrowing methods from bulk {RNA}-seq, which are based on non-zero differences in average expressions of genes across cell populations. Later, several methods specifically designed for {scRNA}-seq were developed. To provide guidance on choosing an appropriate tool or developing a new one, it is necessary to comprehensively study the performance of {DE} analysis methods. Here, we provide a review and classification of different {DE} approaches adapted from bulk {RNA}-seq practice as well as those specifically designed for {scRNA}-seq. We also evaluate the performance of 19 widely used methods in terms of 13 performance metrics on 11 real {scRNA}-seq datasets. Our findings suggest that some bulk {RNA}-seq methods are quite competitive with the single-cell methods and their performance depends on the underlying models, {DE} test statistic(s), and data characteristics. Further, it is difficult to obtain the method which will be best-performing globally through individual performance criterion. However, the multi-criteria and combined-data analysis indicates that {DECENT} and {EBSeq} are the best options for {DE} analysis. The results also reveal the similarities among the tested methods in terms of detecting common {DE} genes. Our evaluation provides proper guidelines for selecting the proper tool which performs best under particular experimental settings in the context of the {scRNA}-seq.},

The presence of such systematic background noise is a potential source of batch effect and spurious differential gene expression. Here we develop a deep generative model for noise-contaminated data that is structured to reflect the phenomenology of background noise generation in droplet-based single-cell assays. The proposed model successfully distinguishes cell-containing from cell-free droplets without supervision, learns the profile of background noise, and retrieves a noise-free quantification in an end-to-end fashion. We present a scalable and robust implementation of our method as a module in the open-source software package {CellBender}. We show that {CellBender} operates close to the theoretically optimal denoising limit in simulated datasets, and present extensive evaluations using real datasets and experimental benchmarks drawn from different tissues, protocols, and modalities to show that {CellBender} significantly improves the agreement of droplet-based single-cell data with established gene expression patterns, and that the learned background noise profile provides evidence for degraded or uncaptured cell types.},

This study was to explore the role and underlying mechanism of {MALAT}1 in acute spinal cord injury ({ASCI}). {ASCI} models in adult rats were established and demonstrated by a numerical decrease in {BBB} scores. Expression profile of {MALAT}1 and {miR}-199b following {ASCI} in rats and in vitro was determined using quantitative real-time {PCR}. {RNA} pull-down assays combined with {RIP} assays were performed to explore the interaction between {MALAT}1 and {miR}-199b. In the present study, {MALAT}1 expression was significantly increased (2.4-fold that of control) in the spinal cord of the rat contusion epicenter accompanied by activation of {IKKβ}/{NF}-κB signaling pathway and an increase in the level of proinflammatory cytokines {TNF}-α and {IL}-1β. Upon treatment with {LPS}, {MALAT}1 expression dramatically increased in the microglia in vitro, but knockdown of {MALAT}1 attenuated {LPS}-induced activation of {MGs} and {TNF}-α and {IL}-1β production. Next, we confirmed that {LPS}-induced {MALAT}1 activated {IKKβ}/{NF}-κB signaling pathway and promoted the production of proinflammatory cytokines {TNF}-α and {IL}-1β through downregulating {miR}-199b. More importantly, {MALAT}1 knockdown gradually improved the hindlimb locomotor activity of {ASCI} rats as well as inhibited {TNF}-α, {IL}-1β levels, and Iba-1 protein, the marker of activated microglia in injured spinal cords. Our study demonstrated that {MALAT}1 was dysregulated in {ASCI} rats and in {LPS}-activated {MGs}, and {MALAT}1 knockdown was expected to attenuate {ASCI} through repressing inflammatory response of {MGs}.},

This study aimed to further explore the relationship between {lncRNA} {MALAT}1 and {miR}-125b-5p, as well as their effect on microglial activation, neuroinflammation, and neural apoptosis in spinal cord injury ({SCI}). Primary microglia from Sprague Dawley rats were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}). Then, microglia were transfected with {lncRNA} {MALAT}1 overexpression or knock-down adenovirus-associated virus with or without {miR}-125b-5p mimic. The culture medium of microglia was incubated with primary neurons. {SCI} rats were established for in vivo validation. {LncRNA} {MALAT}1 expression was reduced by {LPS} treatment in a dose-dependent manner. {LncRNA} {MALAT}1 overexpression suppressed the microglial M1 polarization (decreased {iNOS} but increased {ARG}1), neuroinflammation (declined {PTGS}2, {TNF}-α, {IL}-1β, and {IL}-6), and microglia-induced neural apoptosis (lower {TUNEL} positive cells and C-caspase3 but higher {BCL}2) under {LPS} treatment; its knock-down displayed the opposite trend. Moreover, {lncRNA} {MALAT}1 directly bound to and negatively regulated {miR}-125b-5p. {MiR}-125b-5p mimic promoted microglial M1 polarization, neuroinflammation, and microglia-induced neural apoptosis following {LPS} treatment; also, it could attenuate the effect of {lncRNA} {MALAT}1. Further in vivo study displayed that {lncRNA} {MALAT}1 overexpression elevated the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan motor function score and improved neural injury. Also, in vivo validation indicated a similar effect of {lncRNA} {MALAT}1 on microglial polarization and neuroinflammation as in vitro. {LncRNA} {MALAT}1 improves {SCI} recovery via {miR}-125b-5p mediated microglial M1 polarization, neuroinflammation, and neural apoptosis.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {APOE} genotype is the greatest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease ({AD}). {APOE}4 increases {AD} risk up to 12-fold compared to {APOE}3, an effect that is greater in females. Evidence suggests that one-way {APOE} could modulate {AD} risk and progression through neuroinflammation. Indeed, {APOE}4 is associated with higher glial activation and cytokine levels in {AD} patients and mice. Therefore, identifying pathways that contribute to {APOE}4-associated neuroinflammation is an important approach for understanding and treating {AD}. Human and in vivo evidence suggests that {TLR}4, one of the key receptors involved in the innate immune system, could be involved in {APOE}-modulated neuroinflammation. Consistent with that idea, we previously demonstrated that the {TLR}4 antagonist {IAXO}-101 can reduce {LPS}- and Aβ-induced cytokine secretion in {APOE}4 glial cultures. Therefore, the goal of this study was to advance these findings and determine whether {IAXO}-101 can modulate neuroinflammation, Aβ pathology, and behavior in mice that express {APOE}4.
{METHODS}: We used mice that express five familial {AD} mutations and human {APOE}3 (E3FAD) or {APOE}4 (E4FAD). Female and male E4FAD mice and female E3FAD mice were treated with vehicle or {IAXO}-101 in two treatment paradigms: prevention from 4 to 6 months of age or reversal from 6 to 7 months of age. Learning and memory were assessed by modified Morris water maze. Aβ deposition, fibrillar amyloid deposition, astrogliosis, and microgliosis were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Soluble levels of Aβ and {apoE}, insoluble levels of {apoE} and Aβ, and {IL}-1β were measured by {ELISA}.
{RESULTS}: {IAXO}-101 treatment resulted in lower Iba-1 coverage, lower number of reactive microglia, and improved memory in female E4FAD mice in both prevention and reversal paradigms. {IAXO}-101-treated male E4FAD mice also had lower Iba-1 coverage and reactivity in the {RVS} paradigm, but there was no effect on behavior. There was also no effect of {IAXO}-101 treatment on neuroinflammation and behavior in female E3FAD mice.
{CONCLUSION}: Our data supports that {TLR}4 is a potential mechanistic therapeutic target for modulating neuroinflammation and cognition in {APOE}4 females.},

Combining spectral libraries, {DIA} software, sparsity reduction, normalization, and statistical tests results in 1428 distinct data analysis workflows, which we evaluate based on their ability to correctly identify differentially abundant proteins. From our dataset, we derive bootstrap datasets of varying sample sizes and use the whole range of bootstrap datasets to robustly evaluate each workflow. We find that all {DIA} software suites benefit from using a gas-phase fractionated spectral library, irrespective of the library refinement used. Gas-phase fractionation-based libraries perform best against two out of three reference protein lists.

	abstract = {Studies in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and so on, have suggested that inflammation is not only a result of neurodegeneration but also a crucial player in this process. Protein aggregates which are very common pathological phenomenon in neurodegeneration can induce neuroinflammation which further aggravates protein aggregation and neurodegeneration. Actually, inflammation even happens earlier than protein aggregation. Neuroinflammation induced by genetic variations in {CNS} cells or by peripheral immune cells may induce protein deposition in some susceptible population. Numerous signaling pathways and a range of {CNS} cells have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration, although they are still far from being completely understood. Due to the limited success of traditional treatment methods, blocking or enhancing inflammatory signaling pathways involved in neurodegeneration are considered to be promising strategies for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases, and many of them have got exciting results in animal models or clinical trials. Some of them, although very few, have been approved by {FDA} for clinical usage. Here we comprehensively review the factors affecting neuroinflammation and the major inflammatory signaling pathways involved in the pathogenicity of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We also summarize the current strategies, both in animal models and in the clinic, for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.},

This review summarizes the current knowledge about the diversity/heterogeneity of microglia and distinct microglia states in the brain of both {AD} mouse models and patients, as revealed by single-cell technologies. It also discusses the future developments for application of single-cell technologies and the integration of these technologies with functional studies to further dissect microglia biology in {AD}.

An unbiased {CRISPR}–Cas9 screen identified genetic modifiers of lipid droplet formation; surprisingly, variants of several of these genes, including progranulin ({GRN}), are causes of autosomal-dominant forms of human neurodegenerative diseases.

The main drivers of neuroinflammation are brain-resident glial cells, such as microglia and astrocytes. Microglia are the primary responders to any insult to the brain parenchyma, translating the signals into diverse molecules. These molecules derived from microglia can regulate the stimuli-dependent reactivity of astrocytes. Once activated, astrocytes in turn, can control microglia phenotypes. Recent evidence indicates that the crosstalk between these glial cells plays an important role in delaying or accelerating neuroinflammation and overall disease progression. To date, various molecules have been recognized as key mediators of the bidirectional communication between microglia and astrocytes. The current review aims to discuss the novel molecules identified recently, which play a critical role in interglial crosstalk, highlighting their therapeutic potential.},

Despite this popularity, there are concerns that these methods are being applied incorrectly and the results of some peer-reviewed publications are unreliable. These problems include the use of inappropriate background gene lists, lack of false discovery rate correction and lack of methodological detail. To ascertain the frequency of these issues in the literature, we performed a screen of 186 open-access research articles describing functional enrichment results. We find that 95\% of analyses using over-representation tests did not implement an appropriate background gene list or did not describe this in the methods. Failure to perform p-value correction for multiple tests was identified in 43\% of analyses. Many studies lacked detail in the methods section about the tools and gene sets used. An extension of this survey showed that these problems are not associated with journal or article level bibliometrics. Using seven independent {RNA}-seq datasets, we show misuse of enrichment tools alters results substantially. In conclusion, most published functional enrichment studies suffered from one or more major flaws, highlighting the need for stronger standards for enrichment analysis.},

	abstract = {Mathys et al. conducted the first single-nucleus {RNA}-seq ({snRNA}-seq) study of Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) (Mathys et al., 2019). With bulk {RNA}-seq, changes in gene expression across cell types can be lost, potentially masking the differentially expressed genes ({DEGs}) across different cell types. Through the use of single-cell techniques, the authors benefitted from increased resolution with the potential to uncover cell type-specific {DEGs} in {AD} for the first time. However, there were limitations in both their data processing and quality control and their differential expression analysis. Here, we correct these issues and use best-practice approaches to {snRNA}-seq differential expression, resulting in 549 times fewer {DEGs} at a false discovery rate of 0.05. Thus, this study highlights the impact of quality control and differential analysis methods on the discovery of disease-associated genes and aims to refocus the {AD} research field away from spuriously identified genes.},

The volcano plot suggests a double filtering procedure that selects features with both small adjusted \$P\$-value and large estimated effect size. Despite its popularity, this type of selection overlooks the fact that {BH} does not guarantee error control over filtered subsets of discoveries. Therefore the selected subset of features may include an inflated number of false discoveries.In this paper, we illustrate the substantially inflated type I error rate of volcano plot selection with simulation experiments and {RNA}-seq data. In particular, we show that the feature with the largest estimated effect is a very likely false positive result. Next, we investigate two alternative approaches for multiple testing with double filtering that do not inflate the false discovery rate. Our procedure is implemented in an interactive web application and is publicly available.},

Here we show that nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells ({NF}-κB) signaling, activated by tau, drives microglial-mediated tau propagation and toxicity. Constitutive activation of microglial {NF}-κB exacerbated, while inactivation diminished, tau seeding and spreading in young {PS}19 mice. Inhibition of {NF}-κB activation enhanced the retention while reduced the release of internalized pathogenic tau fibrils from primary microglia and rescued microglial autophagy deficits. Inhibition of microglial {NF}-κB in aged {PS}19 mice rescued tau-mediated learning and memory deficits, restored overall transcriptomic changes while increasing neuronal tau inclusions. Single cell {RNA}-seq revealed that tau-associated disease states in microglia were diminished by {NF}-κB inactivation and further transformed by constitutive {NF}-κB activation. Our study establishes a role for microglial {NF}-κB signaling in mediating tau spreading and toxicity in tauopathy.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive decline, affecting behavior, speech, and motor abilities. The neuropathology of {AD} includes the formation of extracellular amyloid-β plaque and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of phosphorylated tau, along with neuronal loss. While neuronal loss is an {AD} hallmark, cell-cell communication between neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations maintains neuronal health and brain homeostasis. To study changes in cellcell communication during disease progression, we performed {snRNA}-sequencing of the hippocampus from female 3xTg-{AD} and wild-type littermates at 6 and 12 months. We inferred differential cell-cell communication between 3xTg-{AD} and wild-type mice across time points and between senders (astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and {OPCs}) and receivers (excitatory and inhibitory neurons) of interest. We also assessed the downstream effects of altered glia-neuron communication using pseudobulk differential gene expression, functional enrichment, and gene regulatory analyses. We found that glia-neuron communication is increasingly dysregulated in 12-month 3xTg-{AD} mice. We also identified 23 {AD}-associated ligand-receptor pairs that are upregulated in the 12-month-old 3xTg-{AD} hippocampus. Our results suggest increased {AD} association of interactions originating from microglia. Signaling mediators were not significantly differentially expressed but showed altered gene regulation and {TF} activity. Our findings indicate that altered glia-neuron communication is increasingly dysregulated and affects the gene regulatory mechanisms in neurons of 12-month-old 3xTg-{AD} mice.},

Here, we directly explore the potential plasticity of adipocytes and fibroblasts after skin injury. Using genetic lineage tracing and live imaging in explants and in wounded animals, we observe that injury induces a transient migratory state in adipocytes with vastly distinct cell migration patterns and behaviours from fibroblasts. Furthermore, migratory adipocytes, do not contribute to scar formation and remain non-fibrogenic in vitro, in vivo and upon transplantation into wounds in animals. Using single-cell and bulk transcriptomics we confirm that wound adipocytes do not convert into fibrogenic myofibroblasts. In summary, the injury-induced migratory adipocytes remain lineage-restricted and do not converge or reprogram into a fibrosing phenotype. These findings broadly impact basic and translational strategies in the regenerative medicine field, including clinical interventions for wound repair, diabetes, and fibrotic pathologies.},

	abstract = {Neurological diseases are associated with disruptions in the brain lipidome that are becoming central to disease pathogenesis. Traditionally perceived as static structural support in membranes, lipids are now known to be actively involved in cellular signaling, energy metabolism, and other cellular activities involving membrane curvature, fluidity, fusion or fission. Glia are critical in the development, health, and function of the brain, and glial regulation plays a major role in disease. The major pathways of glial dysregulation related to function are associated with downstream products of metabolism including lipids. Taking advantage of significant innovations and technical advancements in instrumentation, lipidomics has emerged as a popular omics discipline, serving as the prevailing approach to comprehensively define metabolic alterations associated with organismal development, damage or disease. A key technological platform for lipidomics studies is mass spectrometry ({MS}), as it affords large-scale profiling of complex biological samples. However, as {MS}-based techniques are often refined and advanced, the relative comfort level among biologists with this instrumentation has not followed suit. In this review, we aim to highlight the importance of the study of glial lipids and to provide a concise record of best practices and steps for {MS}-based lipidomics. Specifically, we outline procedures for glia lipidomics workflows ranging from sample collection and extraction to mass spectrometric analysis to data interpretation. To ensure these approaches are more accessible, this tutorial aims to familiarize glia biologists with sample handling and analysis techniques for {MS}-based lipidomics, and to guide non-experts toward generating high quality lipidomics data.},

In a variety of neurodegenerative settings, microglia alter their transcriptional profile, morphology and function in similar ways; thus, these activated cells have been called ‘degeneration- or disease-associated microglia’ ({DAM}). These activated microglia can perform different functions and exert both positive effects and negative effects in different mouse disease models. In humans, mutations in genes expressed in microglia are linked to various neurodegenerative diseases. Here we provide an overview of the common microglial response to neurodegeneration and key contributing pathways; delineate the multifaceted functions of activated microglia spanning various diseases; and discuss insights from the study of human disease-associated genes. We argue that strong evidence from both mouse models and human genetics causally links the function of activated microglia to neurodegeneration.},

While many protocols have been optimized for optimal cell yield, they have often overlooked the effects that dissociation can have on ex vivo gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that use of enzymatic dissociation on brain tissue induces an aberrant ex vivo gene expression signature, most prominently in microglia, which is prevalent in published literature and can substantially confound downstream analyses. To address this issue, we present a rigorously validated protocol that preserves both in vivo transcriptional profiles and cell-type diversity and yield across tissue types and species. We also identify a similar signature in postmortem human brain single-nucleus {RNA}-sequencing datasets, and show that this signature is induced in freshly isolated human tissue by exposure to elevated temperatures ex vivo. Together, our results provide a methodological solution for preventing artifactual gene expression changes during fresh tissue digestion and a reference for future deeper analysis of the potential confounding states present in postmortem human samples.},

However, while alterations in microglial morphology and gene expression are observed in human postmortem brain tissue, the mechanisms by which microglia drive and contribute to {AD} pathology remain ill-defined. Numerous mouse models have been developed to facilitate the disambiguation of the biological mechanisms underlying {AD}, incorporating amyloidosis, phosphorylated tau, or both. Over time, the use of multiple technologies including bulk tissue and single cell transcriptomics, epigenomics, spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics have shed light on the heterogeneity of microglial phenotypes and molecular patterns altered in {AD} mouse models. Each of these 'omics technologies provide unique information and biological insight.

	abstract = {Polygenic risk scores have identified that genetic variants without genome-wide significance still add to the genetic risk of developing Alzheimer's disease ({AD}). Whether and how subthreshold risk loci translate into relevant disease pathways is unknown. We investigate here the involvement of {AD} risk variants in the transcriptional responses of two mouse models: {APPswe}/{PS}1L166P and Thy-{TAU}22. A unique gene expression module, highly enriched for {AD} risk genes, is specifically responsive to Aβ but not {TAU} pathology. We identify in this module 7 established {AD} risk genes ({APOE}, {CLU}, {INPP}5D, {CD}33, {PLCG}2, {SPI}1, and {FCER}1G) and 11 {AD} {GWAS} genes below the genome-wide significance threshold ({GPC}2, {TREML}2, {SYK}, {GRN}, {SLC}2A5, {SAMSN}1, {PYDC}1, {HEXB}, {RRBP}1, {LYN}, and {BLNK}), that become significantly upregulated when exposed to Aβ. Single microglia sequencing confirms that Aβ, not {TAU}, pathology induces marked transcriptional changes in microglia, including increased proportions of activated microglia. We conclude that genetic risk of {AD} functionally translates into different microglia pathway responses to Aβ pathology, placing {AD} genetic risk downstream of the amyloid pathway but upstream of {TAU} pathology.},

Notably, 5XFAD mice lacking {MHCII} exhibited an enhanced amyloid pathology in the brain along with exacerbated innate inflammation and reduced phagocytic capacity. Using a bone marrow chimera mouse model, we showed that infiltrating macrophages did not differentiate to {MHCII}+ cells following {ICV} injection of Aβ-Th1 cells and did not support T cell-mediated amyloid clearance.

New designations continuously arising in an attempt to describe the different microglial states, notably defined using transcriptomics and proteomics, may easily lead to a misleading, although unintentional, coupling of categories and functions. To address these issues, we assembled a group of multidisciplinary experts to discuss our current understanding of microglial states as a dynamic concept and the importance of addressing microglial function.

	abstract = {Alzheimer disease ({AD}) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disease, estimated to contribute 60–70\% of all cases of dementia worldwide. According to the prevailing amyloid cascade hypothesis, amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in the brain is the initiating event in {AD}, although evidence is accumulating that this hypothesis is insufficient to explain many aspects of {AD} pathogenesis. The discovery of increased levels of inflammatory markers in patients with {AD} and the identification of {AD} risk genes associated with innate immune functions suggest that neuroinflammation has a prominent role in the pathogenesis of {AD}. In this Review, we discuss the interrelationships between neuroinflammation and amyloid and tau pathologies as well as the effect of neuroinflammation on the disease trajectory in {AD}. We specifically focus on microglia as major players in neuroinflammation and discuss the spatial and temporal variations in microglial phenotypes that are observed under different conditions. We also consider how these cells could be modulated as a therapeutic strategy for {AD}.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer disease ({AD}) is biologically defined by the presence of β-amyloid-containing plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles. {AD} is a genetic and sporadic neurodegenerative disease that causes an amnestic cognitive impairment in its prototypical presentation and non-amnestic cognitive impairment in its less common variants. {AD} is a common cause of cognitive impairment acquired in midlife and late-life but its clinical impact is modified by other neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular conditions. This Primer conceives of {AD} biology as the brain disorder that results from a complex interplay of loss of synaptic homeostasis and dysfunction in the highly interrelated endosomal/lysosomal clearance pathways in which the precursors, aggregated species and post-translationally modified products of Aβ and tau play important roles. Therapeutic endeavours are still struggling to find targets within this framework that substantially change the clinical course in persons with {AD}.},

	shorttitle = {{NIA}-{AA} Research Framework},
	abstract = {In 2011, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association created separate diagnostic recommendations for the preclinical, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia stages of Alzheimer's disease. Scientific progress in the interim led to an initiative by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association to update and unify the 2011 guidelines. This unifying update is labeled a “research framework” because its intended use is for observational and interventional research, not routine clinical care. In the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association Research Framework, Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) is defined by its underlying pathologic processes that can be documented by postmortem examination or in vivo by biomarkers. The diagnosis is not based on the clinical consequences of the disease (i.e., symptoms/signs) in this research framework, which shifts the definition of {AD} in living people from a syndromal to a biological construct. The research framework focuses on the diagnosis of {AD} with biomarkers in living persons. Biomarkers are grouped into those of β amyloid deposition, pathologic tau, and neurodegeneration [{AT}(N)]. This {ATN} classification system groups different biomarkers (imaging and biofluids) by the pathologic process each measures. The {AT}(N) system is flexible in that new biomarkers can be added to the three existing {AT}(N) groups, and new biomarker groups beyond {AT}(N) can be added when they become available. We focus on {AD} as a continuum, and cognitive staging may be accomplished using continuous measures. However, we also outline two different categorical cognitive schemes for staging the severity of cognitive impairment: a scheme using three traditional syndromal categories and a six-stage numeric scheme. It is important to stress that this framework seeks to create a common language with which investigators can generate and test hypotheses about the interactions among different pathologic processes (denoted by biomarkers) and cognitive symptoms. We appreciate the concern that this biomarker-based research framework has the potential to be misused. Therefore, we emphasize, first, it is premature and inappropriate to use this research framework in general medical practice. Second, this research framework should not be used to restrict alternative approaches to hypothesis testing that do not use biomarkers. There will be situations where biomarkers are not available or requiring them would be counterproductive to the specific research goals (discussed in more detail later in the document). Thus, biomarker-based research should not be considered a template for all research into age-related cognitive impairment and dementia; rather, it should be applied when it is fit for the purpose of the specific research goals of a study. Importantly, this framework should be examined in diverse populations. Although it is possible that β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau deposits are not causal in {AD} pathogenesis, it is these abnormal protein deposits that define {AD} as a unique neurodegenerative disease among different disorders that can lead to dementia. We envision that defining {AD} as a biological construct will enable a more accurate characterization and understanding of the sequence of events that lead to cognitive impairment that is associated with {AD}, as well as the multifactorial etiology of dementia. This approach also will enable a more precise approach to interventional trials where specific pathways can be targeted in the disease process and in the appropriate people.},

	abstract = {Late-onset Alzheimer disease ({LOAD}) is highly polygenic, with a heritability estimated between 40 and 80\%, yet risk variants identified in genome-wide studies explain only {\textasciitilde}8\% of phenotypic variance. Due to its increased power and interpretability, genetically regulated expression ({GReX}) analysis is an emerging approach to investigate the genetic mechanisms of complex diseases. Here, we conducted {GReX} analysis within and across 51 tissues on 39 {LOAD} {GWAS} data sets comprising 58,713 cases and controls from the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium ({ADGC}) and the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project ({IGAP}). Meta-analysis across studies identified 216 unique significant genes, including 72 with no previously reported {LOAD} {GWAS} associations. Cross-brain-tissue and cross-{GTEx} models revealed eight additional genes significantly associated with {LOAD}. Conditional analysis of previously reported loci using established {LOAD}-risk variants identified eight genes reaching genome-wide significance independent of known signals. Moreover, the proportion of {SNP}-based heritability is highly enriched in genes identified by {GReX} analysis. In summary, {GReX}-based meta-analysis in {LOAD} identifies 216 genes (including 72 novel genes), illuminating the role of gene regulatory models in {LOAD}.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s dementia is significantly more common in women than in men. However, few pathological studies have addressed sex difference in Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) and other brain pathologies. We leveraged postmortem data from 1453 persons who participated in one of two longitudinal community-based studies of older adults, the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Postmortem examination identified {AD} pathologies, neocortical Lewy bodies, {DNA}-binding protein 43 ({TDP}-43), hippocampal sclerosis, gross and micro infarcts, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Linear and logistic regressions examined the association of sex with each of the pathologic measures. Two-thirds of subjects were women (n = 971; 67\%), with a mean age at death of 89.8 ({SD} = 6.6) years in women and 87.3 ({SD} = 6.6) in men. Adjusted for age and education, women had higher levels on a global measure of {AD} pathology (estimate = 0.102, {SE} = 0.022, p {\textless} 0.001), and tau tangle density in particular (estimate = 0.334, {SE} = 0.074, p {\textless} 0.001), and there was a borderline difference between women and men in amyloid-β load (estimate = 0.124, {SE} = 0.065, p = 0.056). In addition, compared to men, women were more likely to have more severe arteriolosclerosis ({OR} = 1.28, 95\% {CI}:1.04–1.58, p = 0.018), and less likely to have gross infarcts ({OR} = 0.78, 95\% {CI}:0.61–0.98, p = 0.037), although the association with gross infarct was attenuated after controlling for vascular risk factors. These data help elucidate the neuropathologic footprint of sex difference in {AD} and other common brain pathologies of aging.},

	abstract = {Despite continuing debate about the amyloid β‐protein (or Aβ hypothesis, new lines of evidence from laboratories and clinics worldwide support the concept that an imbalance between production and clearance of Aβ42 and related Aβ peptides is a very early, often initiating factor in Alzheimer's disease ({AD}). Confirmation that presenilin is the catalytic site of γ‐secretase has provided a linchpin: all dominant mutations causing early‐onset {AD} occur either in the substrate (amyloid precursor protein, {APP}) or the protease (presenilin) of the reaction that generates Aβ. Duplication of the wild‐type {APP} gene in Down's syndrome leads to Aβ deposits in the teens, followed by microgliosis, astrocytosis, and neurofibrillary tangles typical of {AD}. Apolipoprotein E4, which predisposes to {AD} in {\textgreater} 40\% of cases, has been found to impair Aβ clearance from the brain. Soluble oligomers of Aβ42 isolated from {AD} patients' brains can decrease synapse number, inhibit long‐term potentiation, and enhance long‐term synaptic depression in rodent hippocampus, and injecting them into healthy rats impairs memory. The human oligomers also induce hyperphosphorylation of tau at {AD}‐relevant epitopes and cause neuritic dystrophy in cultured neurons. Crossing human {APP} with human tau transgenic mice enhances tau‐positive neurotoxicity. In humans, new studies show that low cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) Aβ42 and amyloid‐{PET} positivity precede other {AD} manifestations by many years. Most importantly, recent trials of three different Aβ antibodies (solanezumab, crenezumab, and aducanumab) have suggested a slowing of cognitive decline in post hoc analyses of mild {AD} subjects. Although many factors contribute to {AD} pathogenesis, Aβ dyshomeostasis has emerged as the most extensively validated and compelling therapeutic target.},
