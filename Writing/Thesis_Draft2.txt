In this study, we investigated how APOE genotype(E3 vs E4) and early-life inflammation interact to shape microglial states in a mouse model of Aβ pathology.Using single-cell RNA sequencing of microglia isolated from EFAD mice treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) orvehicle at postnatal day 9, we identified distinct microglial transcriptional states and assessed their proportionsand gene expression profiles. E4FAD mice exhibited a higher proportion of disease-associated microglia (DAM)compared to E3FAD mice. Moreover, early-life inflammation induced long-lasting, genotype-specific alterations:LPS reduced the abundance of an NF-κB-enriched Cytokine Response microglial population and downregulatedpro-inflammatory genes in E4FAD, but not E3FAD, mice. These findings suggest that early-life immune eventsinteract with APOE genotype to shape microglial responses to amyloid pathology and may offer targets formodulating disease-associated inflammation.Introduction/BackgroundAlzheimer’s Disease and NeuroinflammationAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia worldwide, affecting more than 55 million people as of 2019 (1). It is defined by the accumulation of extracellularamyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular tau neurofibrillary tangles, which are now considered central pathological hallmarks of the disease (2).In addition to these proteinopathies, AD is characterized by widespread synaptic loss, neuronal degeneration, and a robust neuroinflammatory response. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervoussystem (CNS), are key contributors to this inflammatory milieu. They participate in Aβ clearance, phagocytosis,synaptic pruning, and cytokine production, and have been implicated in both protective and pathogenic roles.1234567891011121314151617181920212223241/30The increasing recognition of neuroinflammation as a core feature of AD has led to renewed interest inmicroglial biology, particularly in the context of genetic and environmental risk factors that may shape microglialresponses during disease progression.Microglia in Alzheimer’s DiseaseMicroglia are highly dynamic cells that continually survey the brain parenchyma. Their functions are diverse andinclude responding to injury, clearing debris, and remodeling synapses. Early frameworks categorized microgliaas either “resting” or “activated,” or applied the simplified ‘M1/M2’ designation. These binary models are nowconsidered oversimplified and inadequate for describing the true range of microglial phenotypes observed inhealth and disease.Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have transformed our understanding of microglialheterogeneity. In particular, studies in mouse models of AD have identified a transcriptional program termed Disease-Associated Microglia (DAM), characterized by downregulation of homeostatic markers such as Tmem119and P2ry12, and upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism, phagocytosis, and inflammation, includingTrem2, Apoe, Cst7, and Tyrobp (3), (4).Subsequent work has revealed additional microglial subsets, including interferon-responsive, antigen-presenting, and proliferative populations. However, there is limited consensus regarding nomenclature or functionaldistinctions between these clusters. Moreover, it remains unclear how these states arise, how stable they areacross contexts, and how they relate to disease mechanisms in vivo.Sex Differences in Alzheimer’s DiseaseOne important but often underappreciated aspect of AD is its differential impact on biological sex. Womenrepresent nearly two-thirds of AD patients, and several studies have reported that female individuals exhibitmore severe Aβ plaque burden, increased tau pathology, and faster cognitive decline compared to males (5). Thesedifferences may be influenced by sex hormones, immune system regulation, and differential gene expression,although the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood.2526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647482/30Sex also interacts with genetic risk factors. The APOE4 allele has been associated with a greater increase inAD risk in women compared to men (6). In light of these findings, and because immune responses are known todiffer by sex, this study focuses exclusively on female mice. This choice enhances the interpretability of microglialresponses in a biologically relevant context and avoids the confounding influence of sex-dependent variability.APOE Genotype Modulates Microglial FunctionThe apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease(AD). The three most common alleles, APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4, differ by two amino acid substitutions. Thesedifferences give rise to distinct protein isoforms that vary in their effects on lipid metabolism and amyloid-β(Aβ) clearance (7). Among them, APOE4 is linked to increased Aβ aggregation, reduced clearance, disruptedmicroglial lipid processing, and altered inflammatory signaling, while APOE2 is considered protective (8), (9).Under normal physiological conditions, APOE is primarily produced by astrocytes. However, in the presenceof Aβ pathology, APOE expression in microglia increases substantially. Experimental models using APOEknockouts or humanized APOE alleles have shown that APOE regulates key microglial functions, includingtranscriptional responses to Aβ, phagocytic activity, and the production of inflammatory mediators (4), (10).These observations support the hypothesis that APOE isoforms play a critical role in directing microglialbehavior and may influence their progression into DAM or other disease-associated phenotypes.5xFAD and EFADStudying the interplay between APOE genotype and microglial activation in humans is difficult due to limitedaccess to living brain tissue and the confounding effects of postmortem delay. As a result, transgenic mousemodels have become essential tools for investigating AD mechanisms.The 5xFAD mouse model expresses five familial AD mutations in APP and PSEN1, leading to acceleratedAβ deposition, gliosis, and synaptic degeneration by six months of age (11). However, this model expresses themurine Apoe gene, which differs from the human gene in structure and function.To address this limitation, the EFAD model was created by crossing 5xFAD mice with human APOE knock-in lines. EFAD mice express human APOE2, APOE3, or APOE4 alleles and recapitulate many of the genotype-495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172733/30specific effects observed in humans. E4FAD mice, in particular, exhibit higher plaque load and more pronouncedneuroinflammatory signatures compared to E3FAD or E2FAD mice (12).This model provides a powerful system for dissecting how human APOE isoforms influence microglialresponses to Aβ in vivo.Microglial PrimingIn addition to genetic risk, microglial states may be shaped by early-life environmental exposures. One mechanism through which this occurs is innate immune memory, a process by which transient inflammatory stimuliproduce long-lasting changes in microglial function (13).Previous studies have shown that systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) during early development can lead to persistent alterations in microglial gene expression, inflammatory responses, and behaviorlater in life (14). However, these effects are context-dependent and may differ by genetic background, sex, andtiming of exposure.Work from our laboratory has demonstrated that LPS injection at postnatal day 9 (P9) improves long-termmemory performance and enhances microglial internalization of Aβ in 5xFAD mice (15). These findings suggestthat early immune activation may modulate the trajectory of microglial aging and response to pathology, possiblyin a beneficial manner.Study Rationale and ObjectivesThe current study was designed to test the hypothesis that early-life inflammation interacts with APOE genotypeto shape microglial transcriptional states in the context of Aβ pathology. To investigate this, we used EFAD miceexpressing human APOE3 or APOE4 alleles. At postnatal day 9, animals were treated with LPS or vehicle, andat six months of age, microglia were isolated for single-cell RNA sequencing.This approach allowed us to examine both cell-type proportions and transcriptional profiles across multipleexperimental conditions. Our aim was to determine whether APOE isoform modifies the microglial response toearly-life priming, with a particular focus on disease-associated and pro-inflammatory transcriptional states.7475767778798081828384858687888990919293949596974/30This study is part of a broader investigation integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, histology, andbehavioral analysis to understand how genetic and environmental risk factors converge to influence neuroinflammation in AD.Materials and methodsAnimalsHumanized APOE3 and APOE4 knock-in mice were crossed with the 5xFAD mouse model to generate E3FAD andE4FAD mice, as previously described (Youmans et al., 2012). Wild-type (WT) littermates were used as controls.Mice were housed in a controlled environment (12-hour light/dark cycle, constant temperature and humidity)with free access to food and water. All procedures were conducted in compliance with the European Unionlaboratory regulations for animal experiments and were approved by the Animal Research Committee of LundUniversity.Table 1: Summary of Number of Animals by Genotype and TreatmentGenotypeTreatment# of AnimalsVehicle4E3WTLPS3Vehicle4E3FADLPS3Vehicle4E4WTLPS3Vehicle4E4FADLPS5Total Animals30Experimental procedure and sample processingOnly female mice were used in this study, as described in the Introduction. At postnatal day 9 (P9), E3FAD, E4FAD,and their wild-type (WT) littermates received a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of either lipopolysaccharide(LPS, 1 mg/kg) or vehicle (0.9% saline) (see Table 1 for group assignments). At six months of age, mice wereeuthanized by transcardial perfusion. Brains were rapidly dissected, and the right hemisphere was used formicroglial cell isolation98991001011021031041051061071081091101111121131141151161171181191201211221231241251261271281295/30Microglial enrichment was performed using magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) with CD11b MicroBeads and LS columns. Enriched microglia were further purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)using an ARIA III flow cytometer. Cells positive for CD45, CX3CR1, and CD11b were collected for downstreamanalyses.Cell SequencingFrom each experimental sample, approximately 2,500 sorted microglial cells were loaded for single-cell captureand cDNA library preparation using the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3ʹ v3 reagent kit and workflow.Individual samples were barcoded using cell-hashing antibodies and pooled into groups of four samples persequencing run. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina platform.Raw sequencing data were processed with CellRanger (10x Genomics, v6.1.2) using the mouse referencegenome GRCm39 (mm39). This pipeline included alignment, filtering, barcode counting, and UMI (uniquemolecular identifier) counting to generate feature-barcode matrices for each library.Quality Control, Normalization, and Data CorrectionIndividual libraries were first filtered to remove cells identified as empty droplets or doublets using the HashSoloalgorithm. Additional quality control (QC) filters were applied to each library: cells with fewer than 2,000 totalcounts, fewer than 300 expressed genes, greater than 5% mitochondrial gene expression, or fewer than 5% ribosomal gene expression were removed. The 5% mitochondrial threshold was selected based on recommendationsby Osorio and Cai, who showed that this cutoff effectively excludes apoptotic cells in mouse scRNA-seq data andimproves downstream interpretability (16). Genes expressed in fewer than three cells were also excluded. QCmetrics and visualizations for each sample, both pre- and post-filtering, are included in Supplementary Figure 1and Supplementary Table 1.After filtering, individual libraries were merged into a single dataset using Anndata’s concat function withan outer join along the cell axis and a unique merge for the gene axis. Raw counts were saved as a separate layerbefore normalization. Normalization was performed using Scanpy’s normalize_total function followed by log-transformation with log1p.1301311321331341351361371381391401411421431441451461471481491501511521531546/30Following initial normalization, the merged dataset was examined for the presence of contaminatingnon-microglial cells. Based on clustering, expression of canonical marker genes, and manual annotation, cellsidentified as non-microglia were removed. The dataset was re-normalized after removal of non-microglial cellsusing the same normalization strategy.Highly variable genes (HVGs) were then identified using Scanpy’s highly_variable_genes function withsample ID as the batch key. These HVGs were used for subsequent dimensionality reduction steps, includingprincipal component analysis (PCA).The merged dataset was assessed for batch effects using PCA. Several batch correction methods were tested,including Harmony (integration via latent space correction), BBKNN (graph-based nearest neighbor correction),and ComBat (empirical Bayes adjustment). Ultimately, batch effects were not observed to be significant, and nobatch correction was applied.A high contribution of mitochondrial genes to variance across cells was observed during HVG and PCAanalysis. To reduce this effect, mitochondrial gene expression was regressed out using Scanpy’s regress_outfunction prior to downstream analyses.Table 2: Summary of Datasets Before and After Quality ControlLibraryBeforeAfter# of Cells# of Genes# of Cells# of GenesD1340333989290314987D2504133989469815514D3502933989408115463D4389233989355815052D5382533989360615260D6440833989360315788D7364333989310314935D8390333989360115926Merged--29153173411551561571581591601611621631641651661671681691701711721731741751761771781791807/30Clustering and AnnotationPrincipal component analysis (PCA) was computed on normalized, log-transformed data. Neighborhood graphswere constructed using the top 25 principal components as input after analyzing the scree plot, and UMAPembeddings were calculated with a min_dist parameter of 0.5 to preserve both local and global structures.Leiden clustering (17) was performed iteratively across a range of resolutions (0.1–1.9 in steps of 0.1). UMAPscolored by cluster identities were visually inspected at each resolution to identify regions of high heterogeneityand monitor for under- and overclustering. Annotation started with the highest resolution clustering to capturefine-grained heterogeneity and then merged clusters that showed high similarity in their gene expressionprofiles. Overclustering was identified when newly created clusters did not significantly differ from neighboringclusters in their top differentially expressed genes (DEGs).DEGs were identified using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (rank_genes_groups function). DEGs were calculated for each cluster against the total dataset and neighbouring clusters to merge clusters with insuffiecientlydistinct expression profiles. Expression profile annotations were assigned based on the combination of differential expression profiles, cluster relationships, and comparison to canonical gene signatures described in previousstudies, including Keren-Shaul et al. (3) , Olah et al. (18) , Prater et al. (19) , Mancuso et al. (20) , Sala-Frigerio etal. (21) , Mathys et al. (22), Millet et al. (23), (24), (25).Clusters were annotated into 9 expression profiles; Homeostatic, DAM, MHC-II/Antigen Presentation DAM,Cytokine Response, Cycling(G2M/Cdk1+), BAM-like, Neuronal surveillance/Ribosomal biogenesis, DAM withRibosomal upregulation, and Immediate Early Gene (IEG) Enriched Homeostatic. Naming of profiles was basedon similarity to previously described profiles in the literature, though should not be considered a formal definition.Cluster ProportionsThe proportion of each cluster was calculated as the number of cells in the cluster divided by the total numberof cells in the sample. A three-way ANOVA was performed to assess the effect of genotype (E3 vs E4), treatment(LPS vs Vehicle), and disease status (FAD vs WT) on the proportion of each cluster. An ordinary least squares1811821831841851861871881891901911921931941951961971981992002012022032042058/30(OLS) linear regression model was fit to the data with the proportion of each cluster as the dependent variableand the variable main effects and interactions as predictors. Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference (HSD) testwas used for post-hoc pairwise comparisons between conditions. All statistical analyses were performed usingthe statsmodels package in Python.Pseudobulk AnalysisPseudobulk analysis was performed to more robustly identify DEGs between condition groups as it has beenshown to significantly reduce the number of false positives and increase the accuracy of subsequent enrichmentanalyses as compared to the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (26). The Python package ‘Decoupler’ was used to generatepseudobulk profiles for each individual mouse using the ‘sum’ method. The pseudobulk profiles were then used toidentify DEGs between groups using ‘PyDeseq2’, a python implementation of the DESeq2 algorithm (27,28). TheWald test was used to generate p-values with cook’s filtering and correction for multiple testing using Benjamini-Hochberg method. The model was fit with disease status (FAD vs WT), APOE genotype (E3 vs E4), and treatment(LPS vs Vehicle) as factors with their interactions, and specific comparisons were extracted using the ‘results’function. Genes were considered differentially expressed if they had an adjusted p-value < 0.05 and a log2 foldchange > |0.25|. The pseudobulk DEGs were then used for downstream analysis including Gene Ontology (GO)enrichment analysis and transcription factor inference.Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a statistical method used to determine whether selected sets of genesshow statistically significant differences between two biological states (29). Rather than focusing only on statistically significant DEGs, as other methods do, GSEA evaluates the entire set of genes ranked by a metric whichreflects their different expression between conditions, thereby better capturing the pathway-level enrichmentdifferences.For each contrast of interest, genes were ranked by their Wald test statistic derived from the pseudobulkdifferential expression analysis. GSEA was then performed using the implementation provided in the Decouplerpackage (27), with the MSigDB Hallmark gene sets (30) as the reference collection. This approach enabled the2062072082092102112122132142152162172182192202212222232242252262272282292309/30identification of pathways significantly enriched in up- or down-regulated genes across our conditional contrastsof interest.ResultsCluster Expression ProfilesFollowing dimensionality reduction and Leiden clustering, we identified nine distinct microglial expressionprofiles based on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between clusters and reference to canonical expressionsignatures described in previous studies. Cluster annotation was guided by comparisons to known microglialstates in both mouse and human brain studies, including those by Keren-Shaul et al. (3), Sala-Frigerio et al.(21), Olah et al. (18), Mathys et al. (22), and others. The final annotated expression profiles were: Homeostatic,DAM, MHC-II/Antigen Presentation DAM, Cytokine Response, Cycling (G2M/Cdk1+), BAM-like, NeuronalSurveillance/Ribosomal Biogenesis, Ribosomal DAM, and Immediate Early Gene (IEG) Enriched Homeostatic.These expression profiles are visualized in Figure 1. The UMAP plots (Figure 1a) show cluster organizationacross the entire dataset and by condition. Figure 1b displays the top 10 DEGs for each cluster when comparedto the rest, and Figure 1c shows density plots of cluster distributions per condition.23123223323423523623723823924024124224324410/30Figure 1:  Distinct Expression Clusters and Their Proportions by Conditiona.

UMAP density plotsfor each condition.The Homeostatic cluster was characterized by high expression of canonical microglial maintenance genes,including P2ry12, Tmem119, and Cx3cr1, and served as a reference for identifying more activated or alteredstates. The IEG cluster shared elevated expression of homeostatic markers but also showed upregulation ofimmediate early genes such as Fos, Jun, and Egr1, a pattern that has been interpreted as both a stimulus-responsive microglial state and, alternatively, as a dissociation-induced artifact (23,31).24524624724824925025125225325411/30Two small clusters were also identified. The Cycling cluster was defined by elevated expression of cellcycle and proliferation-associated genes such as Stmn1, Top2a, and H2az1, consistent with previously reportedpopulations of proliferative microglia in AD models and aged brain tissue (21,25,32). The BAM-like (Border-Associated Macrophage-like) cluster was characterized by high expression of perivascular macrophage markersincluding Pf4, Mrc1, and Ms4a7. Although microglial enrichment was performed during FACS, this populationlikely reflects a small number of CNS-associated macrophages retained during sorting.The DAM (Disease-Associated Microglia) cluster showed a transcriptional profile closely matching thatoriginally described by Keren-Shaul et al. (3), including high expression of Trem2, Apoe, Cst7, Tyrobp, and Clec7a,accompanied by suppression of homeostatic genes. Three additional clusters were identified with overlappingDAM features but distinct gene expression signatures. The Cytokine Response cluster exhibited elevated expression of inflammatory chemokines and NF-κB target genes such as Ccl3, Ccl4, and Il1b. The MHC-II/AntigenPresentation DAM cluster was enriched for antigen presentation genes including Cd74, H2-Ab1, H2-Aa, and H2-Eb1. The Ribosomal DAM cluster retained DAM-like features with additional upregulation of ribosomal genes.Expression Profile Propotions Across ConditionsAfter identifying different expression profiles in the dataset, the relative abundance of each cell type wasassessed across experimental conditions. The proportions observed in the eight experimental groups are shownin Figure 2a, with absolute cell counts presented in Supplementary Figure 2 and corresponding values listed inSupplementary Table 2. Disease versus wild-type is the main cause of variation in cell type composition, withthe most pronounced differences observed in the homeostatic and DAM clusters. Homeostatic cells accountedfor 39–56% of the population in WT mice, compared to only 3–17% in FAD mice, representing a statisticallysignificant reduction (ANOVA p < 1e-8; linear model coefficient = +46.2%, p < 0.001). The APOE genotype wasnot associated with a statistically significant change in homeostatic cell proportions, nor was there a significantdifference with LPS treatment.25525625725825926026126226326426526626726826927027127227327427527627712/30Figure 2:  Changes in Cluster Proportions by Conditiona. Stacked Bar plot of the proportion of each cluster in each condition. b. Bar plots of the proportion ofspecific clusters in each condition, significant differences determine by three way anova and Tukey’spost-hoc test and indicated by asterisks.The DAM cluster was absent in all WT groups except for a small proportion (1.9%) in the E3WT LPS groupand ranged from 23-52% in FAD mice. Additionally, E4FAD mice have a larger porportion of DAM microgliathan E3FAD mice (interaction coefficient = +12.3%, p = 0.012), which is consistent with previous single cellstudies. The three clusters representing more “activated” states similar to DAM (Cytokine Response, MHC-II/Antigen Presentation DAM, and Ribosomal DAM), also show zero or very low proportions in WT mice, and aresignificantly increased in FAD mice.The Cytokine Response cluster shows an interesting pattern in which the E4FAD LPS group has a significantly lower proportion of cells compared to the E4FAD vehicle group (Tukey p-adj = 0.028), while the E3FADLPS group is not significantly different from the E3FAD vehicle group (Tukey p-adj = 0.807). This suggests anAPOE isoform-specific effect of LPS priming on this microglial population. This interpretation is supported bya statistically significant three-way interaction term in the ANOVA (p = 0.038) and a notable effect size in thelinear model (coefficient = −15.1%, p = 0.038), indicating that LPS treatment reduces the proportion of CytokineResponse cells specifically in E4FAD mice.27827928028128228328428528628728828929029129229329413/30E4FAD but Not E3FAD or WT Mice Exhibit Reduced NfkB-related Expression after LPS PrimingTo more robustly identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between conditions, pseudobulk analysis wasperformed on the dataset. This involves summing the expression each gene in all cells from an individual mouseto create a single expression profile, aiding in overcoming the sampling variability in single cell RNA sequencing.The pseudobulk profiles can then be used to identify DEGs with methods typically used for bulk RNA sequencingdata, such as DESeq2 which produces fewer false positives than the more common Wilcoxon rank-sum test usedin single cell analysis.Do I need to include justification for pseudobulk analysis? Is this justification more appropriate in the methods section? or discussion?should I include a figure with PCAs/PC metadata association/diagnostic plots?DEGs were identified between the LPS and vehicle treatment groups in the four genetic backgrounds, the resultsof which are visible in the volcano plots in Figure 3a. There are no more than 1 significant DEG which is sharedbetween any of the comparisons. However, as a general pattern it can be seen that the FAD mice have a muchlarger number of downregulate genes in the LPS treatment group compared to the vehicle group, while the WTmice show a much smaller number of downregulated genes.29529629729829930030130230330430530630730830914/30Figure 3: Differentially expressed Genes and Pathways in LPS versus Vehicle Treated Micea.

GSEA of significant pathways in the LPS versus vehicle comparisons computed on Wald teststatistics.31031131231331431515/30When the E3FAD and E4FAD LPS treatment group DEGs are compared, a statistically significant correlation isobserved (Pearson’s r = −0.44, p = 1.5e-5), indicating that genes that are upregulated in E3FAD mice are likelyto be downregulated in E4FAD mice. A number of these genes are those associated with the NfkB pathway,including CCl4, Tlr2, and Nfkbia. Based on the pseudobulk DEGs, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) wasperformed to identify pathways that were significantly enriched in the LPS treatment groups. The results (Fig 3c)show that the top upregulated pathways in both E3WT and E3FAD groups are TNF-a signaling via NfkB, whileit is the top downregulated pathway in the E4FAD group. It does not appear in the significant pathways in theE4WT group, however the top upregulated pathway in this group is Interferon gamma response. Additionally,the E3WT and E3FAD groups show signifcant upregulation of the Inflammatory response pathway and TGFbeta signaling, while the E4FAD group shows downregulation of the Inflammatory response pathway and noupregulation of inflammatory pathways.We also used the pseudobulk DEGs to infer transcription factor activity using the CollecTRI reguloncollection.•Was going to add trasncription factor inference here but decided not to include it.Add a figure and short section showing the top 6-12 trasncription factors that are upregulated on the basis of the pseudobulk analysis. Caninclude network plots. Can show that these top transcription factors are different between E3FAD and E4FAD, in being upstream of theNfkB pathway.Cytokine Response MicrogliaGiven that the dampening of NF-κB-related pathways in the E4FAD LPS group coincided with a reducedproportion of Cytokine Response microglia, the transcriptional profile of this cluster was examined to assess itspotential contribution to the observed pseudobulk differences.The Cytokine Response cluster was marked by elevated expression of genes associated with pro-inflammatory signaling and canonical NF-κB pathway activation. These included the chemokines Ccl3 and Ccl4, theinterleukins Il1a and Il1b, and the TNF family member Tnf. Several key regulators and targets of NF-κB signaling,including Nfkbia, Nfkbiz, and Tnfaip3, were also upregulated. Additional genes enriched in this cluster were31631731831932032132232332432532632732832933033133233333433533633733833934016/30involved in stress response (Atf3, Gadd45b), immune regulation (Cd83, Zfp36, Bcl2a1b), pattern recognition(Tlr2), cytokine signaling (Csf1), and chemokine receptor activity (Ccrl2).These expression patterns are shown in Figure 4. UMAP projections reveal that these transcripts are highlyexpressed within the Cytokine Response cluster, with limited expression in other microglial states. Violin plotsfurther illustrate the cluster-specific enrichment of these genes.Figure 4: Genes in the Cytokine Response ClusterUMAP plots of the dataset colored by the expression of specific genes which are differentially upregulated in the Cytokine Response cluster and which are part of the NF-κB pathway paired with theviolin plots in all clusters.34134234334434534634734834917/30The selective expression of inflammatory genes within this cluster, combined with its reduced abundance inE4FAD mice following LPS treatment, suggests that changes in this microglial state contribute to the largestobserved pathway-level differences in the more conservative pseudobulk analysis.In addition to the upregulation of pro-inflammatory signaling genes, the Cytokine Response cluster wasfound to show elevated expression of several immediate early genes (IEGs), including Fos, Jun, Egr1, andDusp1. This overlap prompted further comparison with the IEG-enriched cluster, which also showed increasedexpression of these same IEGs relative to the rest of the dataset. Despite this similarity, clear differences wereobserved between the two clusters. The IEG-enriched cluster retained high expression of canonical homeostaticmarkers such as Tmem119, Cx3cr1, and P2ry12, which were largely absent in the Cytokine Response cluster. Incontrast, the Cytokine Response cluster was enriched for DAM-associated genes including Apoe, Clec7a, Trem2,and Ctsd, both in comparison to the total population and when directly compared to the IEG-enriched cluster.When compared to the DAM cluster, the Cytokine Response cluster remained distinct. The DAM cluster didnot show enrichment for IEGs or NF-κB pathway-associated transcripts, suggesting that the Cytokine Responsecluster represents a distinct activation state with overlapping features of both DAM and IEG-enriched microglia.These relationships are visualized in the dot plot in figure 5.Figure 5: Comparison of Overlapping and Distinct Features Between Microglial StatesDot plot showing the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs), homeostatic markers, DAM-associated genes, and NF-κB pathway-related transcripts across the Cytokine Response, IEG-enriched,and DAM clusters.

As research intomicroglial involvement in AD has expanded, so too has the understanding of their diverse functional states.However, the molecular mechanisms governing transitions between these states remain poorly defined.Advances in laboratory techniques and in particular single-cell transcriptomics have given us an entirelynew view of microglial heterogeneity. The outdated binary classification of microglia into “resting” or “activated”states has been replaced by an understanding of multiple distinct transcriptional states influenced by diseaseprogression, brain region, age, microenvironment, and genetic background. This shift has been driven bystudies describing specific microglial activation profiles, among which the Disease-Associated Microglia (DAM)program, described by Keren-Shaul et al. (3), remains the most influential. This transcriptional program wasproposed to occur in two stages, dependent on TREM2 signaling, and in response to amyloid deposition.Subsequent studies have identified a broader array of microglial states, including cycling, antigen-presenting,phagocytic, and various pro-inflammatory states. The current challenge in this area of research is integratinga rapidly expanding body of evidence produced with varied model systems, methodologies, nomenclatures andsometimes conflicting interpretations.APOE genotype remains the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, and in thecontext of microglial heterogeneity, its importance has become increasingly apparent. APOE is highly expressedby microglia in response to amyloid pathology and has been shown to modulate a number of microglial functions including phagocytosis, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory signaling. The data presented here provideadditional evidence for APOE-dependent modulation of microglial state. As expected, homeostatic microglia37337437537637737837938038138238338438538638738838939039139239339439539639719/30represented the majority population in wild-type mice and were nearly absent in the presence of amyloidpathology. FAD mice showed a marked shift toward DAM and related activated states, with a significantly higherproportion of DAM microglia observed in E4FAD compared to E3FAD mice. This finding is consistent withprevious studies using humanized APOE models.Early-Life Immune Priming Alters Microglia TrajectoryLPS priming of microglia has been shown to influence their function both acutely and over extended periodsfollowing the initial insult (34). Unpublished data from members of our lab have demonstrated that LPS administration at postnatal day 9 alters the microglial response to amyloid pathology later in life. Changes were observedin the transcriptional levels of specific cytokines, and a microglial population not present in vehicle-treated micewas identified ((15), preprint). These findings, combined with the well-established role of APOE in modulatingmicroglial state and inflammatory signaling, motivated the present analysis to investigate how human APOEisoforms may interact with early-life immune priming to shape microglial phenotypes in the context of AD-related pathology.(should I add a sentence here saying why post-natal day 9?)The data presented here provide additional evidence for the impact of APOE genotype on microglial phenotypes and the modulatory effect of LPS priming. As expected, a majority of microglia in non-disease (WT) micewere assigned to the homeostatic cluster, with near-zero representation in the disease-associated transcriptomicprofiles. In contrast, FAD mice exhibited a substantial shift, with large proportions of their microglial populationsclassified into disease-associated clusters and a corresponding reduction in homeostatic cells. An increasedproportion of microglia in the DAM cluster was observed in E4FAD mice compared to their E3FAD counterparts,consistent with previous studies using mice expressing human APOE alleles.Genotype-Specific Modulation of Inflammatory SignalThe analysis shows a genotype-specific priming effect on the expression of particular cytokines and inflammatory genes, primarily those in the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway. In mice treated with LPS, a downregulationof these genes was observed specifically in E4FAD animals, while an upregulation was seen in the LPS-treatedE3FAD group (Fig. 3). The genes associated with these pathways were not expressed uniformly across themicroglial population, indicating that the observed transcriptional changes were not global but instead reflect the39839940040140240340440540640740840941041141241341441541641741841942042142242320/30behavior of a specific microglial subset. This subset, identified as the Cytokine Response cluster, was not presentin non-disease mice, indicating that its emergence is dependent on amyloid pathology. Cluster-level analysissuggests that the observed pathway-level effect in E4FAD mice treated with LPS is driven by a reduction in theproportion of microglia occupying this state.Contextualizing the Cytokine Response ClusterA Cytokine Response cluster, defined by increased expression of cytokines, chemokines, and NF-κB–relatedgenes, has been observed in other studies. Lee et al. (10) used E3FAD and E4FAD mice challenged with LPS andperformed single-cell sequencing 24 hours later; a cluster enriched for NF-κB–related transcripts was identified,with higher abundance in E3 compared to E4. Mancuso et al. (20) identified a transcriptionally similar populationin their xenograft model, significantly enriched in the presence of amyloid pathology, although no APOEgenotype–specific differences were reported. Hammond et al. (24) analyzed healthy mice across a range of agesand identified microglial clusters with similar chemokine and cytokine expression profiles, which increased inabundance with age. This microglial phenotype has now been identified across multiple models and conditions;however, its functional role in Alzheimer’s disease remains unclear.Beyond the identification of this cluster, cytokine signaling more broadly remains poorly characterizedin the context of AD. Cytokines have been proposed to contribute to increased amyloid-β production andaccumulation (35), and microglial phagocytosis of amyloid-β has been shown to induce cytokine release (36).Other studies have reported that interleukin-1β reduces microglial clearance of amyloid-β (37) and that cytokineproduction is associated with neuronal loss. However, there is also evidence that LPS-induced inflammation canpromote amyloid-β clearance (38). These findings highlight the complexity of cytokine signaling in AD, whichis governed by context-specific feedback loops that depend critically on the specific cytokines, chemokines, andsignaling pathways involved, as well as their timing and intensityContinued investigation of these microglial populations will be important for understanding their function,how they develop and progress, and how they transition across brain regions and in response to disease states.The analysis presented here suggests that this population can be modulated by pre-symptomatic intervention,which may represent a viable therapeutic strategy. This transcriptomic analysis forms part of a larger study42442542642742842943043143243343443543643743843944044144244344444544644744844921/30examining the interaction between early-life LPS priming and APOE genotype. Unpublished data from this studyindicate improved short-term memory performance in LPS-treated E4FAD mice, an effect not observed in their E3counterparts. Taken together, these findings suggest that modulating microglial phenotype at an early timepointmay yield beneficial effects on Alzheimer’s disease–related outcomes.Biological vs. Artifactual: Evaluating Immediate Early Gene ExpressionOne of the subclusters identified in our dataset shows upregulation of immediate early genes (IEGs), mostprominently from the Fos and Jun families, while also retaining expression of canonical homeostatic microglialmarkers. This pattern, referred to here as IEG-enriched, has been previously reported by Marsh et al. (31) whoshowed that it can be induced by enzymatic dissociation during single-cell processing. They found that the useof mechanical dissociation or the addition of transcriptional inhibitors, such as actinomycin D, during enzymaticdissociation could prevent the emergence of this expression pattern. Based on these findings, they concluded thatthis IEG-rich profile represents an ex vivo stress response, and advocated for the use of transcriptional inhibitorsas a standard practice for microglial single-cell experiments.However, more recent studies suggest that this signature may not be purely artifactual. Mancuso et al.(20) generated a single-cell microglial transcriptomic dataset using the App^NL-G-F amyloid mouse model withtransplanted human microglia expressing APOE2, APOE3, or APOE4, and included transcriptional inhibitorsspecifically to address the ex vivo activation signature reported by Marsh. Despite this, they still identified acluster they termed “Transitioning Cytokine Response Microglia” (tCRM), which they describe as “…show highlevels of homeostatic genes but also express CRM markers.” The top 15 DEGs for this cluster (FOS, JUN, DUSP1,KLF2, HSPA1A1A, IER2, IER3, RHOB, JUNB, Ch25H, HSPA1AB, JUND, FOSB, CEBPD, RGS1) are primarilyimmediate early genes and closely resemble the ex vivo stress signature identified by Marsh. While Mancuso etal. did not report any APOE isoform-specific differences in this population, they found that it was significantlyreduced in APOE knockout mice, suggesting that despite the use of inhibitors, this expression profile may reflecta real APOE-dependent microglial state.Further evidence for the biological relevance of this type of expression pattern comes from Millet et al.(23), who performed scRNA-seq on microglia from E3 and E4 × 5xFAD mice aged to 96 weeks. They identified45045145245345445545645745845946046146246346446546646746846947047147247347447522/30a population they termed “Terminally Inflammatory Microglia” (TIM), which was enriched in aged animals andwhich they describe as “marked by concomitant expression of inflammatory genes such as S100a8 and S100a9and immediate early response genes such as Fos, Jun, and Egr1.” Although their protocol did not includetranscriptional inhibitors and they acknowledge resemblance to the ex vivo stress profile reported by Marsh, theyargue that TIMs represent a bona fide microglial state. They support this by showing that similar populationsare seen in human snRNAseq datasets prepared using both mechanical and enzymatic dissociation, and that theTIM cluster is more prevalent in aged brains and modulated by APOE genotype.A more recent study by Mulenge et al. (39) extended the work of Marsh by evaluating the effects of bothdissociation and sorting. They confirmed that transcriptional inhibitors can suppress IEG expression but alsoshowed that FACS sorting itself induces an ex vivo activation signature. Specifically, they found that Zfp36,Dusp1, Jun, Ccl4, Ccl3, Tnf, Socs3, and Hspa1a were consistently upregulated across sorted datasets. However,they noted that this expression was generally elevated across the entire dataset and not confined to specificclusters.In our data, by contrast, these IEG and cytokine-related genes are not uniformly upregulated across thefull microglial population but are instead restricted to the Cytokine Response and IEG-enriched clusters. Thisspatial restriction, along with parallels to expression profiles seen in Mancuso and Millet even in the presenceof transcriptional inhibitors, supports the interpretation that these clusters represent true biological microglialstates, not merely artifacts of tissue processing.Conclusions and Future DirectionsContinued investigation of these microglial populations will be important for understanding their function,how they develop and progress, and how they transition across brain regions and in response to disease states.The analysis presented here suggests that this population can be modulated by pre-symptomatic intervention,which may represent a viable therapeutic strategy. This transcriptomic analysis forms part of a larger studyexamining the interaction between early-life LPS priming and APOE genotype. As part of this effort, additionaldata are being generated to validate these transcriptional findings through complementary proteomic analysisusing mass spectrometry from the same experimental model. Immunohistochemical staining of brain sections47647747847948048148248348448548648748848949049149249349449549649749849950050123/30will be used to validate microglial responses and assess amyloid plaque burden, providing a spatial context forthe observed molecular changes. These datasets will be integrated with behavioral testing results, which havealready indicated improved short-term memory performance in LPS-treated E4FAD mice, an effect not observedin their E3 counterparts. Together, these analyses aim to establish a more comprehensive understanding of howearly-life immune events intersect with genetic risk to influence microglial function and disease progression inAlzheimer’s disease.Supplemental InformationTO PUT IN SUPPLEMENTARY DATA:•QA plots before & after filtering‣mito %‣ribo %‣# genes / cell‣PCA coloured by library, condition‣PCA scree plot•Wilcoxon DEG top genes for each cluster against rest and against closest clusters? probably as a table or attached .xlxs? with logfc/pvals_adj•Pseudobulk plots‣PCA plots‣metadata pca heatmap‣50250350450550650750850951051151251351451551651751851952052124/30Supporting Table 3: Detailed Summary of Quality Control Filtering for Each DatasetDatasetInitialCells(Mito)(Ribo)(LowCounts)(LowGenes)UniqueCells RemovedInitialGenesGenes RemovedFinal CellsFinalGenesD155009719746525003398919002500014987D236838515040034503398918200323315789D3471711018042014803398917800423716189D439689016038024203398918700354815289D542209517039014403398918000378015989D638908815537024103398918900348015089D7440510216545015003398917600390516389D836008014536024003398919100320014889Merged--------286431742952252352452552652752852953053153253353425/30Bibliography1.Global Status Report on the Public Health Response to Dementia. 1st ed.
